 
Welcome to the Time and Magik trilogy, copyright (C) 1988 from Level 9 and Mandarin. This recreates the three key episodes in the struggle to defend creation. When a wave of change sweeps across History, triggered by the Timelords' meddling, only one person is unaffected. You are sitting in the comfort of your own home, debugging your latest program, when suddenly there is a blinding flash...

You are in your own living room, surrounded by the usual clutter of books, mags, half-full cups of cold coffee and the remains of yesterday's lunch. Your hi-fi is blaring out a very loud remixed noise, and the cat is asleep on top of the fish tank. All is well with the world.

You are in your own living room, surrounded by the usual clutter of books, mags, half-full cups of cold coffee and the remains of yesterday's lunch. Your hi-fi is blaring out a very loud remixed noise, and the cat is asleep on top of the fish tank. All is well with the world. You can see a fine golden hourglass on the mantelpiece and a picture of a kindly old man.

OK. 
What now? GET PICTURE
The picture stirs. Its surface ripples, the old man's figure swells out from the flat canvas and he steps forth to stand before you. 
 
He regards you solemnly, his long nose quivering with disapproval, "I am he whom the people of your benighted world name Father Time", he intones. "You have been chosen - though really, I fail to see why - to aid in the defence of history against the evil Timelords. They are nine in number, and all their will and power is bent to mould time for their own vile ends. Your task is to collect nine critical objects from Earth's history - each is marked with the Holy Hourglass - and place them in the cauldron at the end of Time. May Fortune smile upon you!" 
 
His message complete, Father Time steps back into the picture.

Written on it in a scrawly, hurried hand are the words: 
"To the sunset you must go, 
keeping high and never low.

you will find a treasure trove. 
Pitfalls you are sure to meet,

but in the end you're sure to greet

You are in the copse, struggling through the tangled undergrowth, your hands scratched and bleeding. You can see a genuine fire-breathing dragon.

The dragon eats the food ravenously, apparently oblivious to the gouts of flame which periodically belch from his mouth. "Thanks pal, that was delish". He says finally. "Could have done with a bit more charcoal and mustard, though". 
"I think I'll go for a little fly now, to work this lot off. Would you like to come along for a ride?" 
YES
The dragon lets you climb on to his shoulders and you flap merrily back the way you came until you reach the edge of a wide moat surrounded by a high, turfed bank. The dragon tries to fly over it, but he is, unfortunately, a very SMALL genuine fire-breathing dragon, and not really equipped for this sort of thing. He gives a despairing whimper (incinerating a couple of wasps and a bluebottle who had been dreamily tootling along wondering where to stand for dinner), and belly-flops into the water. There is a horrible hissing noise, strongly reminiscent of an awful lot of water being poured over hot coals, and a soggy cloud of black smoke and steam squelches to the bank. The dragon coughs and slinks away miserably. 
You are standing in ankle-deep, scummy water below the south bank of the moat, savouring the heady stench that glurps up from its muddy bottom. You can see a little dragon's wing and a green frog sitting on a lily pad.

You are inside a gigantic clock, which smells of old wood, dust and cobwebs. It is very gloomy and cramped. You can see an olive branch, a silicon chip, a diamond teardrop, an ivory tusk, a little dragon's wing, a dinosaur egg, an oriental rug, a jewellery case, a fine golden hourglass, a lute, a fine metronome, a milestone, a delicate little screwdriver, a Masai spear, a stalk of valerian, the first wheel, a sharp axe, a silver bell, a silver candelabra, a jewelled coffer, a jewelled crown, an emerald, an onyx figurine, a carved lodestone, a lur, an old mattress, an opener, a grubby pick, a curved ruby, a fallen star, huge cogs numbered 1 to 9 and a massive pendulum, hanging from the ceiling.

With a puff of ancient smoke, Father Time appears. 
 
He sneezes loudly, flapping his wizened hands ineffectually at the pallid vapour. "Nasty stuff". He mutters, then clears his throat and draws himself up his full height. "Do not be afraid!" He declaims nobly, ruining the effect by another fit of sneezing, "What you are about to - ashoo! - witness, is the future as it will be if the Timelords are victorious. Time grows short, yet there may still be enough to defeat them". He sniffs and blows his nose vigorously into a corner of his robe, then shuffles away.

It is not one of the clumsy modern things with mismatched, over-sized stones and yards of velvet and fur, but a real old crown, such as were made when the world was young. It has slender gold links, forged by a master smith into a delicate chain, interrupted every now and then by a spray of golden flowers: forget-me-nots, hare bells and speedwell, their tiny petals picked out with many-shaded blue stones, and in the heart of each, a glimmering yellow topaz.

You are in a central area of the Great Hall, a vast room, some 120 metres long, panelled and beamed with golden oak-wood, blackened with the smoke from the central firepit. 
 
At the western end of the Hall is raised the great dais where the Castellan and his honoured guests and family would sit on feast days, backed by a rich, decaying tapestry depicting the chivalric stages of a boar hunt. Twenty feet above the floor of the Hall, and encircling it, runs the minstrels' gallery, its wooden timbers uncared for now and fallen into disrepair; and from the ceiling, a little to one side of the smoke hole, hangs an old mummers' dragon, its painted leather sides cracked and peeling. It sways slightly, creaking quietly as it does so. A few trestle tables are stacked along one side of the Hall, but any chairs have long since been removed, and all seems to be peaceful and disused. A single sunbeam slants down from the smoke hole, faraway in the high roof.

You are in a castle kitchen. A sickly-sweet smell permeates through from the corridor to the north, yet the kitchen itself is clean and neat, save for a thick layer of grime over everything. The pots and pans hang on their hooks, well-ordered and only slightly tarnished. Unburnt logs lie in the great hearth, only needing the spark of flint and tinder to bring them to life again, and beside them the mighty spit stands idle. The platters are stacked neatly in their racks and the huge scrubbed-pine table is bare and empty. It is as if everyone, having finished their work, was suddenly spirited away, never to return - and several purple-red stains on the floor suggest that the spiriting was not done gently.

At the western end of the Hall is raised the great dais where the Castellan and his honoured guests and family would sit on feast days, backed by a rich, decaying tapestry depicting the chivalric stages of a boar hunt. Twenty feet above the floor of the Hall, and encircling it, runs the minstrels' gallery, its wooden timbers uncared for now and fallen into disrepair; and from the ceiling, a little to one side of the smoke hole, hangs an old mummers' dragon, its painted leather sides cracked and peeling. It sways slightly, creaking quietly as it does so. A few trestle tables are stacked along one side of the Hall, but any chairs have long since been removed, and all seems to be peaceful and disused. A single sunbeam slants down from the smoke hole, faraway in the high roof.

Bostog's mouth writhes briefly and you realize that he is trying to smile, an exercise to which he is almost entirely unaccustomed. "I must go now", he says dejectedly. "I won't bid you farewell, because you probably won't. Nobody ever does in these caves". And he shuffles away, humming a whimsical little dirge.

You are in a castle kitchen. A sickly-sweet smell permeates through from the corridor to the north, yet the kitchen itself is clean and neat, save for a thick layer of grime over everything. The pots and pans hang on their hooks, well-ordered and only slightly tarnished. Unburnt logs lie in the great hearth, only needing the spark of flint and tinder to bring them to life again, and beside them the mighty spit stands idle. The platters are stacked neatly in their racks and the huge scrubbed-pine table is bare and empty. It is as if everyone, having finished their work, was suddenly spirited away, never to return - and several purple-red stains on the floor suggest that the spiriting was not done gently.

You open the door and walk through. The door slams behind you. You are in a central area of the Great Hall, a vast room, some 120 metres long, panelled and beamed with golden oak-wood, blackened with the smoke from the central firepit. 
 
At the western end of the Hall is raised the great dais where the Castellan and his honoured guests and family would sit on feast days, backed by a rich, decaying tapestry depicting the chivalric stages of a boar hunt. Twenty feet above the floor of the Hall, and encircling it, runs the minstrels' gallery, its wooden timbers uncared for now and fallen into disrepair; and from the ceiling, a little to one side of the smoke hole, hangs an old mummers' dragon, its painted leather sides cracked and peeling. It sways slightly, creaking quietly as it does so. A few trestle tables are stacked along one side of the Hall, but any chairs have long since been removed, and all seems to be peaceful and disused. A single sunbeam slants down from the smoke hole, faraway in the high roof.

This strange collection of room-sculptures were said to embody the entire history of the world; and it was through her study of them and her practice of the forbidden rites that Het gained her knowledge of things to come, and so nearly overthrew the world and all contained therein...

The plain seems to go on for ever, broken only by three landmarks: a small, steeply pointed, volcanic mountain to the north; a thin, marble tower to the southwest; and a wide, dark forest to the east. Red flowers cover the mound, perfuming the air with the heady smell of magik. You can see a box.

You are on a junction of several sheep tracks. The castle of Cakabol, rumoured to be your destination, is clearly visible in the distance. Its towers rise bright and tall above the plain, yet they are dwarfed by the mountainside into which they have been built. Dark holes and entrances pock the cliff face, and some have smooth, crafted edges, as though put there for a purpose, while from others issue little plumes of smoke.

What now? E
You are in a grand entrance hall. Its former glory has long passed by. The great stone columns still soar up into the vaulted roof, yet they are cracked now, and crumbling; and one has toppled over and lies, broken-backed and dusty, across the floor. Dust hangs suspended in the air, dancing in the sunbeams which pierce the dingy shadows of the place.

At the western end of the Hall is raised the great dais where the Castellan and his honoured guests and family would sit on feast days, backed by a rich, decaying tapestry depicting the chivalric stages of a boar hunt. Twenty feet above the floor of the Hall, and encircling it, runs the minstrels' gallery, its wooden timbers uncared for now and fallen into disrepair; and from the ceiling, a little to one side of the smoke hole, hangs an old mummers' dragon, its painted leather sides cracked and peeling. It sways slightly, creaking quietly as it does so. A few trestle tables are stacked along one side of the Hall, but any chairs have long since been removed, and all seems to be peaceful and disused. A single sunbeam slants down from the smoke hole, faraway in the high roof.

You are in a castle kitchen. A sickly-sweet smell permeates through from the corridor to the north, yet the kitchen itself is clean and neat, save for a thick layer of grime over everything. The pots and pans hang on their hooks, well-ordered and only slightly tarnished. Unburnt logs lie in the great hearth, only needing the spark of flint and tinder to bring them to life again, and beside them the mighty spit stands idle. The platters are stacked neatly in their racks and the huge scrubbed-pine table is bare and empty. It is as if everyone, having finished their work, was suddenly spirited away, never to return - and several purple-red stains on the floor suggest that the spiriting was not done gently.

You are on a grassy mound which rises a few metres above a sea of waving grass. The plain seems to go on for ever, broken only by three landmarks: a small, steeply pointed, volcanic mountain to the north; a thin, marble tower to the southwest; and a wide, dark forest to the east. Red flowers cover the mound, perfuming the air with the heady smell of magik. You can see a purple potion and a box.

You are in a ruined stone house, scarcely more than a heap of rubble, though a deep alcove survives in the remains of one overgrown wall. This house seems an ideal place to cache your loot. You can see some silver bars, some iron coins, a crown, a medallion, a necklace, a pearl, an emerald, a book, a black ball, a horseshoe, a scroll, rare spices, a sword, a cloak, leather gloves, a ring, a shield, a suit of chain mail, a linen shirt, wellington boots, a gas mask, a flask, some tubing, an axe, a crowbar and a dagger. Congratulations! You have completed your quest, restored the Red Moon, and saved the Kingdom of Baskalos!

Welcome to the Price of Magik, the third part of Time and Magik, copyright (c) 1988 from Level 9 and Mandarin. 
 
The Red Moon crystal was recovered and guarded for many years, gaining intensity. But its power proved too tempting for one magician; Myglar by name. Thinking to have eternal life, he stole the moon and locked himself away. One last hero would have to defeat this last threat to history and recover the crystal, even if it meant paying the price of magik...

You are on a dark and winding drive just to the south of a house, whose venerable magnificence has decayed through years of abandonment and neglect. It stands, desolate and hollow-windowed, a malevolent shadow of its former self. Gnarled creepers cling desperately to the walls, almost completely enveloping the building. A huge carved door with a blackened brass knocker in the shape of a griffin's head is set in the middle of the sprawling facade. You can see a vine.

You are in a rickety woodshed which is slowly sinking into the dank marsh that has grown up and engulfed the grounds of the house. Its timbers are rotting - livid patches of mold and rank orange fungus dot its sides - and the air is redolent with decay. You can see a candle and a woodpile.

You are on a herb garden on an insect-infested mound which rises through the marsh mist. A few stunted plants survive miserably among the stark, skeletal remains of their fellows. Droplets of water gather sadly on their leaves, before dripping quietly onto the cold ground below. You can see an elder cross, a mandrake and some eyebright flowers. 
What now? TAKE ALL
Eyebright flowers: taken.

You are on some steps made of rickety wood, that climb through a narrow stone shaft from darkness into darkness. The sound of running water booms faintly in the distance. You can see a metallic golem. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". The metallic golem stamps its feet. 
What now? EXAMINE METALLIC GOLEM
Grins cheerfully, revealing a fortune in gold fillings. It has just passed a screen test for the leading role in "The Robots are Coming! (Part IX)", and hasn't killed anyone for at least three days. It looks very uncomfortable in armour. It is wearing some silver mail.

You are in a stupendous cavern. Quartz crystals sparkle, many-coloured, in the walls, and delicate stone pillars soar into darkness, towards an unseen roof.

What now? E
You are in a grotto, a small cave, carved by the passage of water long since gone, into fantastic shapes and hollows. Here is the likeness of a lion's head; there, a whale sports amid the billowing waves. Crystalline angels flit beneath the roof, their wings alive with gemstones, and on the floor below writhe sparkling snakes, each coil the work of a thousand thousand years. The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? SE
You are in a web cavern, justly named, for a single mighty cobweb stretches across it, woven from strands as thick as spun steel and suspended from stalactite to stalagmite. You can see a crowbar and a web. On it is a giant spider. There is a feeling of magik. It attacks you but you dodge. The giant spider stares angrily at you.

You are in a watery tunnel, cold and damp. You can see a colossal bloodworm. It attacks you. The blow strikes your plate armour (which has 37 stamina points left). The colossal bloodworm lumbers heavily forwards. The bat sees the bloodworm, (even he can't miss a thing that size) and swoops upon it with a happy cry. The bloodworm howls, turns tail and lollops off into the gloom, hotly pursued by the bat. Unfortunately, the little pest is back within moments, his small shoulders quivering as he tries to get his breath. "Lost the fat ***!" He wheezes bitterly.
