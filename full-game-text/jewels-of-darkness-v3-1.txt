(This version allows you to use RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE to save a position in memory, and OOPS to "take back" bad moves).
You are standing beside a small brick building at the end of a road from the north. A river flows south. To the north is open country and all around is dense forest.

What now? DROP COINS
Dropped. 
What now? TAKE LAMP
OK. 
What now? EXAMINE LAMP
You've never seen anything like this lamp before. In place of a wick and oil reservoir, it contains a tiny egg-shaped bead of glass, and a couple of metal cylinders. 
What now? TAKE KEYS
OK. 
What now? TAKE BOTTLE
OK. 
What now? E
You are on a small hill. To the north, an active volcano throws a plume of ash into the air. A path leads east and you can see a small brick building surrounded by woodland far away to the west. To the south, a spire rises into the clouds. 
What now? S
You are lost in the forest. 
What now? S
You are standing beside a huge oak tree in the depths of the forest. A partly-broken branch hangs down, resting one end on the ground, and you could easily climb the tree if you tried. 
What now? S
You are at a picnic spot littered with small tables and benches carved roughly from tree-trunks. In the centre, a large stencilled sign saying 'no litter' is attached to one of the tables. 
There are some sandwiches here.
What now? TAKE SANDWICHES
OK. 
What now? EXAMINE SANDWICHES
The sandwiches seem to be organic honey between wholemeal bread. 
What now? W
You are in a valley beside a stream which cascades along a rocky bed on its way south. The valley is lined by woodland trees and you can hear birds singing from their branches. 
What now? FILL BOTTLE
OK. 
What now? S
You are in a tree-lined valley beside a stream which seeps away down many small cracks in the ground. Downstream, to the south, the valley narrows and the streambed contains only dry rocks. 
What now? S
You are in a 20-foot depression in a deep, narrow valley sloping down to the south. The steep sides of the valley are overgrown with brambles. 
There is a large padlocked grate set into the ground. 
What now? EXAMINE GRATE
It is made of wrought-iron and set firmly into the ground. The grate looks just large enough for you to go through. 
What now? OPEN GRATE
The grate is unlocked.

There are some coins here.
What now? SAY PLUGH
It is dark, you cannot see. 
What now? ON LAMP
The lamp is on. You are in a huge room with passages to the south and west and a maze of broken rock to the east. 'Y2' is carved on a rock in the very centre of the room. 
What now? S
You are in a low north-south passage at a hole in the floor. This goes down to an east-west passage below. 
There are silver bars here.
What now? DOWN
You are in a dirty broken passage. To the east is a low crawl and to the west is a large passage. There is a hole in the ceiling above. 
What now? W
You are in a large room knee-deep in dust. There are cracks everywhere and a passage leading east. You could wriggle down a hole to a junction below. 
What now? DOWN
You are at a complex junction. A low hands and knees passage from the north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a 5 foot passage going west. You could also climb up through a hole in the ceiling. A salty smell blows from the north and you can hear a quiet murmuring. 
What now? W
You are in Bedquilt, a long east-west passage with holes all around. There are so many holes that you can't tell which is which and so exploration can only be at random. 
What now? W
You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese. It smells a bit cheesy too. Obvious passages lead west, east and northeast, but there could well be others. 
What now? W
You are at the eastern end of a long room with two pits in the floor. You are near the east pit, and the many thin stone slabs littering the room would make descending it simple. A path bypasses the pits to connect passages from east and west. There are holes all around, but the only large one is high above the west pit, out of easy reach. 
What now? W
You are at the west end of the twopit room, above a deep pit. A passage continues west. 
What now? DOWN
You are at the bottom of the west pit - 20 feet below the floor of twopit. You can see a large hole in the wall far above. 
A tiny wilting seedling whispers 'water, water'
What now? WATER PLANT
The plant bursts into incredible growth, reaching upwards into the air and throwing out enormous leaves. Eventually it stops, towering over your head and yelling 'WATER! WATER!' In your ear.

A fair-sized beanstalk sways about, waving its leaves and shouting 'WATER! WATER!'

You are in the spider's lair, surrounded by thick sticky web. The stench is unbearable but fortunately there is no spider in sight. Round, narrow entrances lead east and west through the web. 
What now? W
You are in a slimy east-west passage, almost blocked by strands of thick grey web to the east. A rain of water cascades from the walls and ceiling, forming a small stream which trickles away to the west. The drip of water drowns out all other sounds. 
What now? W
You are in a low east-west passage beside an underground stream. Water trickles down the sides of the passage leaving brown stains and the stream is really getting quite deep. 
What now? W
You are beside an underground stream. To the west the water completely fills the passage, but there is a narrow opening to the north.

You are swept along by the stream and held below the water. The current is not particularly strong, however, so you feel that you are in no danger. 
What now? UP
You are on the edge of a massive underground reservoir which stretches as far as the eye can see. An opaque cloud of white mist rises from the lake and streams upwards and south through the only exit. You can hear splashing water from within the mist: obviously the lake is filled by a large stream. 
What now? S
You are in a huge north-south canyon, partly filled by white mist seeping from the north. Far above, an enormous two-sided mirror is suspended between the cavern walls.

The east wall is covered by trophies and the mounted heads of elves and monsters with a carved granite throne standing beneath them. The hall is hung about with the tattered remains of rich tapestries and has large doorways on all sides. 
What now? UP
You are at the east end of the Hall of Mists, filled with wisps of cloud which sway to and fro as if alive. There are passages on both sides and a narrow path leading up to a small opening above. A grand stone staircase leads downwards to the north. 
What now? E
The passage from the east ends here. At your feet is a pit from which mist coils upwards. 
What now? E
You are in a splendid chamber in an east-west canyon. The walls are frozen rivers of orange stone and a carved pillar rises to the ceiling 30 feet above. The floor is formed from smooth marble slabs and is slightly worn in the centre. 
What now? E
You are in an awkwardly sloping east-west canyon. 
What now? E
You are in a room filled with debris washed from the surface. The cobbles end here, but an awkward canyon continues west. 'The magic word is XYZZY' is scratched on the wall in crude runes. 
What now? E
You are crawling painfully over cobbles in a low passage. A dim light filters from the east. 
What now? E
You are in a tiny rocky cave below a grate to the surface. A low crawl leads west into darkness. 
The grate is open and light streams in through it. 
What now? UP
The elves are waiting for you in a golden host surrounding their king. They cheer wildly as you emerge into the sunlight. 
You scored 1100 out of 1100. The elves raise you on high and carry you through the forest in triumph, singing 'All hail to the conquering hero, victorious over the perils of the depths!
All hail to the saviour of the elvish race! All hail to thee, GRANDMASTER ADVENTURER!'
