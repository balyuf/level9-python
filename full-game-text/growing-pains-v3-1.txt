Why do socks have their ingredients listed but not all foods? It is most odd.

Pandora has got a crush on Tony Benn, just like the one she had on Bob Geldof. She says that older men are exciting. I am trying to grow my moustache. Valentine's Day soon.

Which of the following shall I do?
1) write "Ever Yours" instead;

Sunday February 14th SEXAGESIMA. ST VALENTINE'S DAY.
At last I have a valentine from somebody who is not a blood relation! Pandora's card was charming, she had written a simple message of love: "Adrian, it is you alone".
 
My father threw the Sheffield card in the waste-bin. My mother took it out when my father had gone to the pub. Inside it said, "Pauline, I am in anguish." My mother smiled and ripped it up.

2) smile and relax;

3
I choose the Cornet. It is small and easy to carry.

Thursday March 18th.
My father went to work. After school I walked home along the canal bank. I found him bossing a gang of skinheads and punks about. They were surly and unco-operative. None of them wanted to get their clothes dirty.

Britain has bombed Port Stanley airport and put it out of action.

Friday May 14th.
Got an airmail letter from Hamish Mancini, the American we met on holiday last year. After reading and rereading it I think it means that Hamish is coming to stay with us in two days! I haven't told my parents yet. My mother said that he ruined her adulterous holiday avec Lucas with his constant yapping.

1) wait to catch my mother in a good mood;
2) leave the letter where my mother will find it;
3) phone him to put him off.

Saturday May 15th SCOTTISH QUARTER DAY.
When I got in, I made a fuss over my poor pregnant mother. When she was in a good mood I told her about Hamish. She pulled her lips tight, but she didn't go mad. 
 
Monday May 17th.
Hamish Mancini is here. He arrived at 5.30 am. Having taken a taxi from Heathrow Airport (130 miles!) He made a terrible faux pas at breakfast. He asked my mother, "Hey, Pauline, where's that guy, Lucas?" There was an awful silence. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) kick Hamish under the table;
2) keep my head down;
3) change the subject quickly.
3
I change the subject quickly and ask what Hamish would like to do today. He says, "Why don't we promenade around this little old town and take in the ancient ruins?" I tell him that there aren't many in Leicester, but we could go and see Bert and Queenie. They are both ancient ruins. 
 
In the afternoon we went to see Bert and Queenie. Hamish was beside himself with joy. He kept saying "Jee-sus! A genuine Derby and Joan!" 
 
Saturday May 22nd.
We took Hamish to the fun fair on our recreation ground. Hamish was disappointed that it wasn't like Disneyland. 
What shall I do?
1) stand sadly by the Tunnel of Love;
2) go on the Flying Whiplash;
3) go on the dodgems.
3
I go on the dodgems with my mother. It is dead good. I think I'll be a stock car racer when I'm older. 
 
Sunday May 23rd SUNDAY AFTER ASCENSION. NEW MOON.

Mr Scruton summoned the whole school into the assembly hall this morning. Even the teachers who are atheists were forced to attend. He said, "Today at three minutes to nine a future King of England was born." Claire Neilson shouted, "How much did he weigh?" Mr Scruton smiled and ignored her. Pandora shouted, "How much will he cost?" And Mr Scruton suddenly developed good hearing and ordered her out of the hall. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) give her a supportive smile;
2) walk out in sympathy with her;
3) do nothing.
3
I do nothing. How can I when Scruton's ferocious eyes are scanning the whole hall for the slightest twitch? 
 
Tuesday June 22nd.
Pandora has been put in isolation at school. She is working at a desk outside Scruton's office. 
What shall I do?
1) organize a petition in her support;

Choose one of the following for me:
1) bring a saucer of milk to the doorstep;
2) pick it up and take it inside;
3) ignore it back.
3
I ignore it back. Later I find that it has gone to stay at the Singh's. I hope Roy likes curry and chapatis. 
 
Hamish has gone skiing on a dry slope with Pandora. I hope they both break something, preferably their necks. 
 
Monday July 12th HOLIDAY (NORTHERN IRELAND).
Hamish is spending every waking moment at Pandora's house. A telegram has arrived from America. It was addressed to MANCINI but I opened it in case his mother had dropped dead or something. It was from Mom begging him to come home. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) deliver it to Pandora's house;
2) do nothing;
3) phone him at Pandora's.
3
I phone him at Pandora's and read it out, telling him to hurry home. He says, "Hey, man, don't get spaced out. I'll be there real soon. I just gotta say my goodbyes to Pan for the really great times we've had." It takes him three hours to say his goodbyes! 
 
Tuesday July 13th.
Hamish has gone home to Mom. The next time he runs away I hope he goes to Cape Horn or the Artic Circle or anywhere I'm not likely to be. 
 
Friday July 16th.
Queenie is ill. Bert rang at dinner-time to ask us to go round. Queenie was lying on the big saggy bed looking gruesome (she hadn't put her artificial cheeks or lips on). She said, "I've been having pains like red hot needles in my chest." My mother phoned for an ambulance. It was a good job that she did because while it was coming Queenie went a bit strange and started talking about ration books and stuff. My mother went in the ambulance and me and my father stayed behind to comfort Bert. Two hours later my mother rang to say that Queenie had had a stroke and would be in hospital for ages. Bert said, "What am I going to do without my girl to help me?" 
What shall I do?
1) say, "How about going back to the Alderman Cooper Sunshine Home for a while";
2) suggest that Bert comes home with us;
3) promise that we will help to look after him.
3
I promise that we will help to look after him. My father nods his agreement and Bert murmurs, "Thanks, Adrian." 
 
Saturday July 17th.
My mother has been round at Bert's all day cleaning and cooking. My father is going to call in every day on his way home from the canal. I have promised to take horrible Sabre for his morning and evening walks. I must let Pandora know about Queenie and Bert. It would be nice for Bert if she could visit him. 
Choose one of the following for me:

I iron Bert's giant underpants. While I am doing it, Pandora walked in carrying a jar of home-pickled beetroot. I was transfixed. Bert sent me off to make some tea. I looked yearningly at Pandora as I handed her her tea. And she looked yearningly back at me!!!!! Later, when he was asleep in bed, we fell into each other's arms with little sighs and moans. Sex didn't cross my mind once. On the way home, Pandora said that she realized she still loved me when she saw me ironing those horrible underpants. She said, "Only a superior type of youth could have done it." 
 
Monday July 19th.
I, Adrian Mole, score 49 percent, which makes me a worthy schoolboy.
 
My father took Bert to see Queenie in hospital, so I went to Sainsbury's on the bus. My mother gave me thirty pounds and told me to buy enough food for five days. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) ask for a shopping list;
2) stock up on Vesta curries and Instant Whip;
3) buy cheap wholesome food.
3
I buy cheap wholesome food like vegetables, brown rice and yogurt. In our last Domestic Science lesson, Mrs Appleyard had shown us how to make cheap meals with maximum nourishment. My mother didn't thank me when I handed her fifteen pounds change! She whined on and on about forgetting the frozen gateaux and tinned peas, and she went mad when she saw that I hadn't bought a white thick-sliced loaf. 
What shall I do?
1) hurry back to Sainsbury's before it closes;
2) say she could make her own bread;
3) say she can do her own shopping next time.
3
I say she can do her own shopping next time. She says, "Right, I'll do MY shopping. You can do your own." That sounds like trouble to me. 
 
Monday August 2nd BANK HOLIDAY (SCOTLAND). HOLIDAY (REPUBLIC OF IRELAND).
I, Adrian Mole, score 49 percent, which makes me a worthy schoolboy.
 
Tuesday August 3rd.
Went to Grandma's to eat proper food for a change.
 
Friday August 6th.
Went to see Queenie in hospital. She is on a ward full of old ladies with sunken-in faces. It's a good job Queenie was wearing her rouge, I wouldn't have recognized her without it. She can't speak properly so it was dead embarrassing trying to work out what she was saying. 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) stay for a while and smile a lot;
2) make a note to bring a book next time;
3) leave as quickly as I can.
3
I leave as quickly as I can as I've got nothing to say and I hate hospitals. 
 
Saturday August 14th.
My mother is fed up. She is just sitting round the house smoking and sighing. She's been like it ever since she came back from the "Well Woman" clinic. Perhaps she's not well. 
 
Monday August 16th.
I, Adrian Mole, score 48 percent, which makes me an average schoolboy.
 
Brainbox Henderson has started a youth club magazine and is offering a prize for the best poem. I have submitted some of my Juvenilia plus a more mature poem called Ode to Engels, or Hymn to the Modern Poor. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) show it to my parents;
2) send a copy to John Tydeman at the BBC;
3) read it to Pandora.
3
I read it to Pandora who says it is a work of genius. 
 
Tuesday August 17th.
Brainbox Henderson showed me Barry Kent's entry for the poetry competition. Kent is convinced his "Tulips" will win the first prize of five pounds: 
Nice, red, tall, stiff, 
In a vase, 
On a table, 
In a room, 
In our house. 
What shall I do?
1) say nothing;
2) admire its economy;
3) say it is pathetic.
3
I say it is pathetic but Henderson says it shows Japanese cultural influences. How stupid can you get! The nearest Kent has been to Japanese culture is the pillion of a stolen Honda. 
 
Saturday August 28th.
Found a strange device in the bathroom this morning. It looked like an egg-timer. It said "Predictor" on the side of the box. I hope my mother is not dabbling in the occult. 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) ask her what it is;
2) warn my mother about the dangers of the occult;
3) turn it upside down to see what happens.
3
I turn it upside down to see what happens. Later, I heard her complaining to my father that "the bloody thing didn't work". I kept quiet as I guessed she meant the Predictor. 
 
Sunday August 29th TWELFTH AFTER TRINITY.
The paper reports GEC as saying the Nimrod project is within budget and going well. I expect this means it will be finished by 1983.
 
Monday August 30th LATE SUMMER HOLIDAY (UK EXCEPT SCOTLAND).
I, Adrian Mole, score 47 percent, which makes me a middling schoolboy.
 
Tuesday August 31st.
The Royal Hospital phoned with a message for my father to say that a close friend had been taken into ward ten and would he please ring immediately. It was a mystery to all of us. My father hasn't got any close friends. He was speaking for about fifteen minutes. When he came back he said, "I've got something to tell you both".
 
He informed me and my mother that he is the father of Stick Insect's one-day-old baby boy. 
 
I, Adrian Mole, score 47 percent, which makes me a middling schoolboy.
 
That's the end of this part of the game. Would you like to continue with the next part? 
YES

Welcome to part 3 of the Growing Pains of Adrian Mole, from Level 9 and Virgin Games. If you are loading from tape, and it is still running, STOP THE TAPE IMMEDIATELY.
 
Wednesday September 1st.
My father has gone to see Brett and Stick Insect. My mother made him go. So once again I am living in a broken home. 
 
Friday September 3rd FULL MOON.
Queenie Baxter died at 3 o'clock this morning. She had a stroke in her sleep. Bert said it was a good way to go, and I am inclined to agree with him. Bert doesn't know what to do about death certificates and funeral arrangements, etc. So Pandora's father came round to help. 
 
Pandora is taking canoing lessons in preparation for her River Wye holiday. She has her first lesson today and invited me to watch. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) decline;
2) ask to join in;
3) accept.
3
I accept. I will be on hand to save her with the kiss of life if she falls out and nearly drowns. 
 
Saturday September 4th.
Pandora looked dead erotic in her black wetsuit and crash helmet. And for the first time in yonks I felt my thing moving on its own. I can't remember any more about the canoe lesson, so I was unable to join in Pandora's enthusiastic conversation on the way home in her dad's car. Pandora and her parents are leaving for the River Wye on Saturday. 
What shall I do?
1) plead to go along too;
2) try not to look rejected;
3) offer to look after their house.
3
I offer to look after their house. 
 
Sunday September 5th.
Pandora's parents have accepted my kind offer and entrusted me with their keys. It is a massive responsibility. 
 
Monday September 6th LABOUR DAY (USA AND CANADA).
Mr Braithwaite is very worried about Queenie's funeral. The cheapest he can arrange will cost 350 pounds, but her funeral insurance is only thirty. 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) suggest a loan;
2) raise money;
3) say, "Ask the Social Security to do it".
3
I say, "Ask the Social Security to do it". Bert is dead upset by this as he wants a proper funeral. 
 
Thursday September 9th.
Queenie's funeral today. It was dead sad. Now Bert is on his own again, and will need more looking after than ever! 
 
Saturday September 11th.
Waved goodbye to my love today. She blew kisses from the rear windows of the Volvo Estate then vanished round the corner.
 
I let myself into their house to watch the big colour telly and couldn't help noticing a letter on Mr Braithwaite's desk:
 
Dear Chairperson, 
Arthur, it is with the deepest regret that I offer my resignation as vice-chairperson of the Elm Ward Labour Party. The Committee has moved so far to the right recently that I find my own moderate views and opposition to witch-hunts labelled as extremist...
 
The letter was signed Ivan Braithwaite. There was a stamped addressed envelope lying next to it. Obviously he had been too busy to post it. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) post it;
2) tear it up;
3) leave it alone.
3
I leave it alone. The Labour Party is hardly likely to return to Socialism in the next week, so he can post it himself when he gets back. 
 
Monday September 13th.
I, Adrian Mole, score 49 percent, which makes me a worthy schoolboy.

Saturday October 2nd.
Our lawn looks like a jungle now my father isn't cutting it.
 
Thursday October 7th.
Courtney Elliot, the postman, didn't bring my mother's Social Security giro this morning. It should have been here yesterday. 
What shall I do?
1) go to school worrying;
2) do nothing;
3) tell my mother to ring up.
3
I tell my mother to ring up the DHSS, but their line is permanently engaged. 
 
Friday October 8th.
No giro. My mother is going to go to the Social Security Office. 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) hope she gets it;
2) say, "Good luck!";
3) skive off school and go with her.
3
I skive off school and go with her because it is no place for a pregnant woman alone. 
 
The man at the Social Security Office told my mother that the giro would be in the post tonight. He wouldn't even lend her anything, though my mother did ask nicely. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) sob, "Mummy, Mummy, when will we eat again";
2) take my mother home;
3) refuse to leave until they do something.
3
I refuse to leave until they do something to help. They did do something. They sent a big man round to our side of the counter and he helped me to leave. 
 
Monday October 11th COLUMBUS DAY (USA). THANKSGIVING DAY (CANADA).
I, Adrian Mole, score 52 percent, which makes me a mediocre youth.
 
No giro. Courtney Elliot lent my mother five pounds. 
 
Tuesday October 12th.
No giro. But a cheque arrived from my father. My mother is thinking about ripping it up, like she did the last one. 
What shall I do?
1) say, "Take the money!";
2) take it to Mr Cherry's to cash it;
3) say, "Throw it away".
3
I say, "Throw it away", even if it does mean going hungry. 
 
Friday October 15th.
A Tydeman letter! Alas, yet another rejection. The gods are not yet smiling on me.
 
Monday October 18th.
No giro! 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) face another Mars-less day with courage;
2) say, "Why not ask Grandma Sugden for a loan?";
3) suggest we try our MP.
3
I suggest we try our MP. My mother got his number from the Citizens' Advice Bureau and rang him up. He wasn't there. His wife said bitterly that he had gone on a fact-finding mission to the Canary Isles. 
 
Thursday October 21st.
No giro! My mother cracked today. She phoned the local radio station and told them she was going to abandon her child at the Social Security Office unless she was given her giro. They have got until noon today to contact her. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) look forward to this;
2) beg her to keep me out of it;
3) sit and wait for noon.
3
I sit and wait for noon. 
 
It worked! The presence of reporters caused a mini-riot at the Social Security office when my mother turned up to abandon me. Police were called and Mr Gudgeon gave my mother an Emergency Needs Payment of 25 pounds. We'll get the rest next week. 
 
Monday October 25th HOLIDAY (REPUBLIC OF IRELAND). MOON'S FIRST QUARTER.
I, Adrian Mole, score 51 percent, which makes me an unimportant youth.
 
When I got home from school my mother's little suitcase was missing from the hall. She is nowhere in the house. 
What shall I do?
1) rush around the house;
2) visit Mrs O'Leary;
3) phone the police.
3
I phone the police. A bored sergeant asked if I'd looked for a message from her. I said no. My mother left a note on the biscuit tin. It said: 
I am in the labour ward of the Royal Infirmary. Call a taxi. 5 pound note at the bottom of the spaghetti jar. Don't worry. 
Love, Mum. 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) call my father at Grandma's;
2) tip out the note;
3) call a taxi and grab the money.
3
I call a taxi and grab the money. The taxi ride was a nightmare. I was struggling to get my hand free of the spaghetti jar all the way. The taxi driver kept saying, "You should have tipped the jar upside down, you stupid bleeder." 
 
At the hospital I ran in and found the lift and pressed the button marked "Labour Ward". I emerged into another world. It was like the space control centre at Houston. A technician asked me whether I had permission to visit the labour ward. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) ask whose permission I need;
2) say, "Yes";
3) say, "No".
3
I say, "No", and he directs me to the waiting room. The room was full of worried-looking men, smoking and talking about cars. I looked for something to read, but all I could see were tatty copies of Autocar and Motoring. 
What shall I do?
1) pace around the room;
2) try to wait patiently;
3) dig among the magazines.
3
I dig among the magazines and find an old Reader's Digest. Now I can increase my word-power while my mother increases our family. After about 2 hours, a nurse comes to find me. She tells me that my mother and sister are both well. 
 
The baby started crying in a crabby way and she was put on my mother's flatter belly. My mother looked at her as if she was a precious piece of jewellery. 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) congratulate my mother;
2) look at them both and smile, then slip away;
3) say nothing.
3
I say nothing. I am speechless with emotion. The doctor says to me, "You've got a beautiful daughter, Mr Mole." When I tell him that I'm her brother, not her father, he looks startled and orders me out immediately. 
 
7.30 pm. Home. For some reason I was dead tired. I put all my smashable possessions on the top shelf and went to bed.
 
8.15 pm. The phone wakes me up. It is my father gibbering about having a daughter. He wants to know all about her. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) tell him everything I can remember;
2) say she takes after him;
3) ask him to ring again in the morning.
3
I ask him to ring again in the morning. I am too tired to talk now. 
 
Friday October 29th.
My father brought my mother and sister home this morning. My mother went up to bed and my father hung about for a bit then went home to Grandma's. The midwife came in the afternoon. She said that my mother was suffering from after-baby blues and asked me who was looking after my mother. I said I was. She said that my mother needs more support. 
What shall I do?
1) give my mother the pillows off my bed;
2) arrange for Mrs Singh and Mrs O'Leary to help;
3) phone Grandma.
3
I phone Grandma. She says she has already got too much on her plate with my father, Stick Insect and Brett, but she will come round if she can. 
 
Saturday October 30th.
My mother and I have been trying to decide what to call the baby. My mother has made out this list of names: Charity, Christobel, Zoe, Jade, Frankie, India, Rosie, Caitlin and Ruth. 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) suggest "Pandora" instead;
2) say we should ask my father;
3) say I like "Rosie" and "Ruth".
3
I say I like "Rosie" and "Ruth".

Everybody has gone bonfire mad! They are all discussing firework parties and displays. Even Barry Kent seems interested. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) offer to help with the Marriage Guidance Council Bonfire;
2) arrange my own fireworks party;
3) help Barry Kent collect "pennies for the guy".
3
I help Barry Kent collect "pennies for the guy" with menaces. After all, we are in Thatcher's Britain. 
 
Thursday November 4th.
Barry Kent has persuaded me to provide the guy. 
What shall I do?
1) make a real guy;
2) dress up;
3) wrap the dog in a blanket and balaclava.
3
I wrap the dog in a blanket and balaclava and push it about in Pandora's old dolls' pram. 
 
Friday November 5th BONFIRE NIGHT.
The dog was a disaster as a guy. It kept jumping up, barking and licking people. So Barry Kent forced me to squeeze into the pram instead. 
 
Saturday November 6th.
At four o'clock, I was asked by my so-called best friend Nigel to go to his Hallowe'en party. He said, "Forgot to send you an invite, zit face, but come anyway. Dress as a warlock or you won't get in." 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) ask if Pandora can come too;
2) accept;
3) turn down the invite.
3
I turn down the invite, saying I wouldn't be seen dead at his place. 
 
Locked the dog in the coal shed, as advised by the media. Then went to the Marriage Guidance Council Bonfire party. It was crowded with couples bickering over the fireworks. 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) go to where the rockets are being lit;
2) try to pacify them;
3) slip away with Pandora.
3
I slip away with Pandora and a packet of sparklers. I wrote "PANDORA" in the air with my sparkler. Pandora wrote "ADRAIN". She ought to know how to spell my name by now. Went back to the community bonfire and found our dog watching the firework display and chewing a hot-dog. I lost count of the times nosy adults said, "That dog should be locked up out of harm's way". 
What shall I do?
1) tell them to mind their own business;
2) take the stupid dog home;
3) explain that our dog is an individualist.
3
I explain that our dog is an individualist and can't be treated like other dogs, but with the crowd going, "Oooh!" And, "Aaaah!" Every time a pathetic rocket is launched, it is a bit difficult. 
 
Monday November 8th.
I, Adrian Mole, score 46 percent, which makes me an ordinary schoolboy.
 
Sunday November 14th REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY.
I long for the day when I buy my first studio flat in Hampstead.
 
Monday November 15th.
Nigel managed to get some photos of me, dressed up as Guy Fawkes. He is showing them round school. I may have to emigrate. 
 
Wednesday November 17th.
Nigel has proved we live in a police state. Britain has three times as many police per head as South Africa. And I bet we have fewer black policemen.
 
Friday November 19th.
I wish vandals would carve their names on flowering cherries and leave decent trees alone.

3
I audition for a part. I hope to get to play Ernest. 
 
Monday November 29th.
Mr Golightly gave me a speech about Victoria Station to read, listened, then said: "Yes, you'll do." I have decided to be an actor when I grow up. I will write my novels during breaks in rehearsal. 
 
Thursday December 2nd.
When I said, "Hello" to Pandora in Geography my voice wobbled out of control. I kept quiet for the rest of the lesson.

My mother asked why I was so quiet. She said, "Is anything wrong." 
Which of the following shall I do?
1) tell her my voice had gone wobbly;
2) whisper, "Sore throat";

3
I say, "No" in a shrill voice and leave the room. 
 
Monday December 6th.
I, Adrian Mole, score 46 percent, which makes me an ordinary schoolboy.
 
My voice can't be trusted. One minute it's booming like Ian Paisley, and the next it's shrill and shrieking like Margaret Thatcher's used to be before she had voice lessons from an advertising agency. 
What shall I do?
1) suffer patiently;
2) go to see Dr Gray;
3) take a vow of silence.
3
I take a vow of silence until it has sorted itself out.
 
7 p.M. It is very difficult to get people to pass the ketchup if you have taken a vow of silence. 
 
Wednesday December 8th.
Am to be Ernest in the school play. Mr Golightly gave me a copy to bring home today.
 
6 pm. I have been right through the play and can't find any speeches marked Ernest!
 
8 pm. My mother has told me that Ernest is actually called John, and we have found lots of speeches, all marked Jack. It is most confusing. Rehearsals start in earnest tomorrow. 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) begin to learn my lines;
2) ask for a smaller part;
3) resign because of my voice.
3
I resign because of my voice. It is too unreliable. 
 
Monday December 20th.
I, Adrian Mole, score 45 percent, which makes me a suburban schoolboy.

1) wait to see who sends me one;
2) sort out which cards to send to which people;
3) write greetings to all my friends.
3
I write greetings to all my friends and put them in the Elf post. 
 
Tuesday December 21st.
The school's post service is as bad as the GPO's. I posted Pandora a card before assembly but she still hadn't had it by the end of the last lesson. 
What shall I do?
1) describe it to her;
2) find out which first-years are on Elf duty;
3) do nothing for a day.
3
I do nothing for a day but if it hasn't arrived by tomorrow I shall complain. 
 
Wednesday December 22nd.
Spent all day watering the Braithwaite's plants. It can't be healthy living amongst so much vegetation. 
 
Friday December 31st.
Had cards back from six of the people that I sent cards to, (which means that four have been wasted) plus three from other kids (which means I shall have to buy some more).

Choose one of the following for me:
1) suggest hypnosis;
2) sigh and agree;

I had to look after Rosie while my parents swanned down to the pub. I was also in charge of the pork and roast potatoes and switching on the greens. I fed Rosie OK, but now she needs changing. 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) change her yukky nappy;
2) wait for Rosie to complain about it;
3) ignore it.
3
I ignore it and act surprised when my mother points out there was a yukky smell in the room. 
 
10 pm. My father is back. How do I feel about it? They've had reconciliations before, so I think I'll reserve judgement until the slopping has stopped and they're back to normal. 
 
Friday January 14th.
After school, I went to Smiths to read the magazines.

2) go to get a handful of bog paper;
3) grab last week's copy of the Sunday Times.

The water workers have gone on strike, so my father made us all have a bath tonight. The dog included.

Which of the following shall I do?
1) try weight-lifting;
2) write to their union;
3) hope the water workers prolong the strike.
3
I hope the water workers prolong the strike until I've left full-time education. 
 
Wednesday January 26th.
A water main has burst at the end of Laurel Close. Workmen came to stop the leak, but because of the strike they selfishly refused to restart the water - even though my father explained we were all Labour voters. Stupid unions, don't they realize when they are helping the Tory government? 
What shall I do?
1) 'phone the council for a water tanker;
2) collect rainwater;
3) get my father to borrow some water containers.
3
I get my father to borrow some water containers from the Braithwaites - they use the five gallon kind in their caravan. My father fills them at Pandora's and brings the water home by car. 
Choose one of the following for me:
1) take everything into the kitchen;
2) turn off the immersion heater;
3) refill the attic tank.

I refill the attic tank so we can use a bit of hot water for washing up and showers. I put the full containers beside the sink as drinking water.
