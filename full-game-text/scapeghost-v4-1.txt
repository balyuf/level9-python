 
Welcome to "Scapeghost", copyright (C) 1989 from Level 9 Computing. 
My head cleared, I looked around, and found myself standing among a crowd of dark suits at a funeral. How had I got there? What was going on? 
 
The last thing I remembered was driving in the motor with Sarah, on our way to meet with the drugs gang. Our long patient months of undercover work were about to pay off. But what had happened then? 
 
I stared around at the others, as a priest mouthed platitudes over a nearby grave, and wondered who had copped it this time. Then I read the name on a nearby wreath...
 
(This version allows you to use RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE to save a position in memory, and UNDO to take back bad moves).
 
I was standing beside my own grave. I could see some mourners, a detective, a pebble, a new wreath and a mound of earth. 
 
As the mourners prepared to file away, ignoring me, I was still rooted to the spot. This was going to take a bit of getting used to.

I drifted north and was by Joe Danby's grave. It was a well-tended spot, for this was a man who had been loved by many in the village. I could see some thistledown. The inscription on the stone read, "The great Landlord has called 'Time' on our Joe". 
What now? GET THISTLEDOWN
I took the thistledown. I felt slightly stronger. 
What now? W
 
I floated west and was in a circular clearing between the graves. I could see a sundial. The moon had risen, casting a faint shadow across the top of the sundial. 
What now? W
 
I hovered west and was in a patch of swishy grass, heavy with dew. The webs of a thousand spiders glistened like frost. 
What now? W
 
I drifted west and was among an untidy group of old tombstones, leaning sleepily together. Others were obscured behind a veil of uncut grass. This peaceful part of the cemetery seemed so old that even its ghosts had faded and only Nature remained. 
What now? NW
 
I hovered northwest and was by a grave covered in marigolds, their gold evoking the memory of summers past. I could see a petal. The marigolds must have been beautiful in the Summer, and even now there were still some in flower. 
What now? GET PETAL
I took the petal. My strength seemed to be increasing. I dropped the thistledown. 
What now? E
 
I drifted east and was by a granite cenotaph. A small flowerbed of poppies had been grown around the base of the monument. 
What now? E
 
I floated east and was by the tomb of David Ridge, with its imposing headstone. I could see a sarcophagus. Here lay someone who didn't want to be forgotten. 
A haunting breeze carried away the "What now" prompts. 
> E
 
I drifted east and was beneath a copper beech. Golden leaves rustled gently in the breeze. I could see a dry leaf and some jumbled stonework. 
 
The tree cast a long shadow across the leaves that carpeted the ground. 
> GET LEAF
I took the dry leaf. I felt a little more solid. I dropped the petal. 
> S
 
I hovered south and was in a circular clearing between the graves. I could see a sundial. 
> S
 
I floated south and was at a corner in the gravel path which wound west to a shed and south beside the church. I could see a matchbook. I felt a strange pull towards the east. 
> GET MATCHBOOK
I took the matchbook. My control over material objects was improving. I dropped the dry leaf. 
> W
 
I drifted west and was at the end of the path outside an old weather-beaten shed. I could see a shed door. In it was a lock. On the shed door was a rope handle. 
> W
 
I hovered west and was west of the shed where a pile of twigs and branches lay rotting. I could see a heap of branches and a cart. In it was the cemetery supervisor. He was carrying a faded wreath. A hedgehog snuffled its way over - or through - my feet. "That makes a change", I thought, "being run over by a hedgehog". 
The cemetery supervisor put the faded wreath on the heap of branches. 
My strength seemed drained by the presence of the cemetery supervisor. My hands became weak and I dropped the matchbook. 
> EXAMINE HEAP
It was an untidy heap of prunings and wind-broken wood. In it was a twig. On the heap of branches was a faded wreath. 
The cemetery supervisor coughed noisily. He drove the cart to the east. 
> EXAMINE WREATH
It was faded and tatty; its flowers wilted and leaves shrivelled. On it was a yellow card. 
> GET CARD
I took the yellow card. I began to feel a much more experienced ghost. 
> GET TWIG
I took the twig. I congratulated myself with my power over heavier objects. I dropped the yellow card. 
> E
 
I drifted east and was at the end of the path outside an old weather-beaten shed. I could see the cemetery supervisor, the workman, a shed door and a cart. In the shed door was a lock. On the shed door was a rope handle. The workman was carrying a shovel. 
The cemetery supervisor stomped inside through the door. The workman walked inside through the door.

I drifted east and was at a corner in the gravel path which wound west to a shed and south beside the church. I could see a dry leaf.

Twilight gave way to darkness and the street lights came on to the south of the cemetery. I felt myself begin to disperse into the night air, and when I came to I was back beside my own grave. 
 
A ghostly figure entered from the north and made its way towards me...
 
> EXAMINE FIGURE
Joe Danby was the ghost of the landlord of one of the local pubs. He was a good sort, always ready to help out. 
 
The figure greeted me with a warm smile and introduced himself. "I'm Joe Danby, that used to run the Pig and Whistle", he said. "Turned my toes up nearly five years ago, I did, and couldn't return to haunt my pub because they don't serve spirits. I've got to know this place quite well in that time". 
 
Joe spread his arm in a wide arc, prompting me to take a look at the cemetery. "Come on", he added, "follow me and I'll show you around the place and introduce you to some of my kindred spirits". Joe Danby hovered north. 
> N
 
I floated north and was by Joe Danby's grave. It was a well-tended spot, for this was a man who had been loved by many in the village. I could see Joe Danby. 
 
On Sundays, there would always be a fresh wreath or bunch of flowers on Joe's grave, and someone came regularly to cut the grass around it. 
 
Joe Danby gave me a broad grin and announced, "Here's my grave. Right next to yours. I can see us being good neighbours". 
 
I returned a smile and admired the well-mown grass. "It gets cut every Sunday, through the Summer", he explained. "I had some good friends". 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Joe Danby drifted north. 
> N
 
I hovered north and was among the new graves, a neatly aligned set of black and white headstones and crosses. I could see Joe Danby. The neat rows stretched off into the distance. 
Joe Danby hummed quietly. He drifted north. 
> N
 
I hovered north and was by the Willmot graves where a tombstone bore a double inscription under the word "reunited". I could see Joe Danby, Bert Willmot, Edna Willmot and a green wreath. A pair of squirrels chattered and squabbled over an acorn at the foot of the grave, before chasing one another west. 
Joe Danby hummed quietly. 
 
He beckoned me to come closer. "These are the Willmot graves", he said in a low whisper. "And if you thought the dead rest in peace, you should listen to this couple". 
> EDNA, HELLO
Edna Willmot returned my greeting with a smile. 
 
"What was that, Mr Danby?", shouted Bert. 
"Oh", replied Joe. "I was just telling the new fellow what a lovely couple you and Edna make". He grinned to me, "I think it's time to pass on". Joe Danby floated southwest. 
> SW
 
I drifted southwest and was beneath a copper beech. Golden leaves rustled gently in the breeze. I could see Joe Danby, a petal and some jumbled stonework. Something moved within the stonework. 
Joe Danby hovered west. 
> W
 
I floated west and was by the tomb of David Ridge, with its imposing headstone. I could see Joe Danby, David Ridge and a sarcophagus. There was something challenging about this grave. Something which seemed to say, "Prove that you're worthy to be here". 
Joe Danby stared blankly into the night. 
 
He whispered, "Always has to prove something, does our David. He may have gone to meet his maker, like, but still he claims to be a self-made man". 
> EXAMINE SARCOPHAGUS
It was a marble coffin, decorated like a miniature Greek temple. On it was an urn. 
 
Joe Danby greeted David with a tight smile. "Still practising with your psychic powers, I see", he said, as David lifted up a moth and spun it high into the air. 
> ROCK URN
I pushed the urn and it rocked slightly. 
 
"Hmm, not bad for a beginner", began David, who was obviously impressed, though trying not to show it. "I might consider helping you now", he added. 
Joe Danby grinned and said in a whisper, "Well done, lad. You kicked that Greek style bucket good and proper". 
Joe Danby hovered northwest. 
 
David Ridge conjuring up a breeze. 
> DAVID, FOLLOW ME
He nodded slowly. 
> NW
 
I hovered northwest and was by Colonel Rycroft's tombstone, in the shadow of the war memorial to the south. I could see Joe Danby and Colonel Rycroft. The tall tombstone still stood stiffly to attention, unbowed by the passing years. 
 
Joe Danby continued with his guided tour. "And this is Colonel Rycroft's grave", he said. "An extinct ex-soldier is the Colonel. Bit stiff. Served his country well in the old days, but he's rather stuck in his ways. Can't stand the young louts we sometimes get here of a night". David Ridge entered from the southeast. 
> COLONEL, HI THERE!
Colonel Rycroft returned my greeting with a smile. 
 
"Evening, Joe", barked the Colonel. "I see you've brought along the new chap". 
 
He held out his hand, but it went straight through me when I tried to shake it. The Colonel laughed and said, "Not too solid yet, eh? You'll have firmed up some before the night is out". Joe Danby floated southwest. 
> SW
 
I drifted southwest and was by a grave covered in marigolds, their gold evoking the memory of summers past. I could see Joe Danby and some thistledown. 
Joe Danby hovered south. David Ridge entered from the northeast. 
> S
 
I drifted south and was by the headstone of Violet Conway, beside the hedge. I could see Joe Danby, Violet Conway and a dogwood bush. A spider span a broad web between its branches and the neighbouring headstone. 
 
Joe Danby said, "Violet Conway's our oldest resident. Cracked as well as croaked. She went blind in life and now won't leave her grave in case she can't find her way back. It's nonsense of course; we ghosts don't need eyes to see". David Ridge entered from the north. 
> VIOLET, HI
Violet Conway grinned warmly. 
 
"I'm certainly all ears", replied Violet. "And you must be Alan, the new arrival". She gave me a warm, friendly smile. 
"You must forgive me if I don't follow you", she continued, "but if I wandered too far from my grave, I might never find my way back again". Joe Danby hovered south. 
> S
 
I floated south and was by a toppled sepulchre, overgrown with weeds and grass. I could see Joe Danby. It must have been an impressive construction once, but nothing stands forever. 
Joe Danby drifted south. David Ridge entered from the north. 
> S
 
I floated south and was by Edith Dean's headstone in a remote and lonely corner of the cemetery. I could see Joe Danby, Edith Dean, some gravel and a vase. Edith seemed to be sniffling quietly. 
 
Joe Danby sighed and said, "And by no means least, this is the last resting place of Edith Dean". David Ridge entered from the north. 
> EDITH, NICE WEATHER TODAY
Edith Dean wept softly and said, "I'd like to help you, but I'm cursed to remain here until the end of time". 
 
Joe Danby lowered his voice. "If 'resting' is the word. Edith used to be a real hypochondriac; scared to death of catching germs off things; the rumour is that she OD'd on carrots. So nowadays she reckons she's cursed or something". 
> N
 
I drifted north and was by a toppled sepulchre, overgrown with weeds and grass. 
Joe Danby entered from the south. David Ridge entered from the south. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
Joe Danby concluded his guided tour, saying, "Well, that's most of your new neighbours introduced. I hope you haven't been bored to death". 
 
He laughed warmly and I had to smile. "I guess that's more of your graveyard humour", I replied. Joe laughed again and continued, "I can see we're going to get along all right. Do you mind If I walk with you? We don't want you getting lost on your first night, do we?". 
> NE
 
I hovered northeast and was among an untidy group of old tombstones, leaning sleepily together. Others were obscured behind a veil of uncut grass. 
Joe Danby entered from the southwest. David Ridge entered from the southwest. 
> E
 
I hovered east and was in a patch of swishy grass, heavy with dew. The dew was painful to my feet and I thought wryly that I should have died with my boots on - preferably wellies. 
Joe Danby entered from the west. David Ridge entered from the west. 
> E
 
I hovered east and was in a circular clearing between the graves. I could see a sundial. 
Joe Danby entered from the west. David Ridge entered from the west. 
> EXAMINE SUNDIAL
It was a top-heavy stone ornament, with a fluted pillar and a round top on which its gnomon cast a faint shadow. 
> JOE, WAIT THEN PUSH SUNDIAL
Joe Danby nodded in acknowledgement. 
> PUSH SUNDIAL
I pushed the sundial and it began to rock heavily. 
Joe Danby pushed the sundial and it teetered and keeled over. The heavy sundial crashed down the steps, breaking into pieces as it fell to the ground. 
Joe Danby tutted and sighed, "You're worse than the vandals around here". 
> GET GNOMON
I took the gnomon. My strength had reached its peak for my first night as a ghost. 
Joe Danby grinned, "I guess you're one spirit that's not weak". I dropped the twig. 
> SW
Did you know that you can go quickly to a far off place? Eg "RUN TO VAULT" or "GOTO VIOLET"
 
I floated southwest and was at the end of the path outside an old weather-beaten shed. I could see a shed door. In it was a lock. On the shed door was a rope handle. I knew that there must be things in that shed that would help me, if only I could get to them. 
Joe Danby entered from the northeast. David Ridge entered from the northeast. 
> W
 
I floated west and was west of the shed where a pile of twigs and branches lay rotting. I could see a matchbook, a yellow card and a heap of branches. 
Joe Danby entered from the east. David Ridge entered from the east.

I floated west and was by a toppled sepulchre, overgrown with weeds and grass. 
Joe Danby entered from the east. David Ridge entered from the east.

I floated south and was by Edith Dean's headstone in a remote and lonely corner of the cemetery. I could see Edith Dean, some gravel and a vase. 
 
Edith saw the gnomon and smiled with relief. "Oh, I'm so happy!", she announced. "I'm free from my curse now that you've brought about the end of time...". 
Joe Danby entered from the north. David Ridge entered from the north. 
 
Edith Dean smiled delightfully and said, "I think I'll take a nice walk around the cemetery, now that I'm free of my curse". 
> EDITH, FOLLOW ME
Edith Dean nodded in acknowledgement.

I drifted east and was at the end of the path outside an old weather-beaten shed. I could see a shed door. In it was a lock. On the shed door was a rope handle. 
Joe Danby entered from the west. David Ridge entered from the west. Edith Dean entered from the west. 
> EXAMINE LOCK
It was a galvanised iron lock for the shed door. In it were a barrel, a short lever, a medium sized lever and a long lever. 
> JOE, WAIT 3 THEN PUSH LONG LEVER
Joe Danby nodded in acknowledgement. 
He stared blankly into the night. 
> DAVID, WAIT 2 THEN PUSH MEDIUM LEVER
David Ridge nodded obediently. 
Edith Dean hummed quietly. 
> EDITH, WAIT THEN PUSH SHORT LEVER
Edith Dean nodded obediently. 
Joe Danby hummed quietly. 
> PUSH BARREL
Joe Danby pushed the long lever briefly into place. David Ridge pushed the medium sized lever briefly into position. Edith Dean pushed the short lever briefly into place so that it wasn't obstructing the barrel. 
I turned the barrel and unlocked the door. 
Joe Danby rubbed his hands, saying, "Only you would have been good enough to unlock the door and let us in". 
> E
 
I hovered east and was at a corner in the gravel path which wound west to a shed and south beside the church. I could see a dry leaf. 
Joe Danby entered from the west. David Ridge entered from the west. Edith Dean entered from the west. 
> S
 
I floated south and was on a wide gravel path leading south from the graves. I could see a dog, a thermometer and a crumbling abbey wall. 
 
The spotlight illuminated the whole of the southern part of the cemetery. 
Joe Danby entered from the north. 
 
"It's beyond me why they bother collecting money", commented Joe whilst pointing at the thermometer. "This place is past repair; the first storm of winter will have the whole wall down. Look at those cracks deep in the stone". David Ridge entered from the north. Edith Dean entered from the north. 
 
The dog seemed to notice me and began to shiver a little. It opened its mouth to bark, but only managed a dry choking noise. 
I began to feel weak because of the spotlight. My hands became weak and I dropped the gnomon. 
> PAT DOG
I stroked the dog. The dog wagged its tail a little, but still seemed to be frightened of me. 
Joe Danby didn't seem to be able to do anything, except point weakly at the spotlight. Edith Dean refused to do anything until somebody turned off the spotlight. The dog darted north. 
> N
 
I floated north and was at a corner in the gravel path which wound west to a shed and south beside the church. I could see a dog and a dry leaf. 
Joe Danby entered from the south. David Ridge entered from the south. Edith Dean entered from the south. 
 
The dog ran in circles, choking harshly. 
> PAT DOG
I stroked the dog. The dog lost some of its fears and sniffed me nervously. 
Joe Danby hummed quietly. 
 
"Come here, doggy", said Joe in a soft voice. But the dog just growled. 
> PAT DOG
I stroked the dog. The dog must have realised that I wasn't going to hurt it, and it became quite friendly. 
Joe Danby said, "Well, well. We've made a new friend". 
Joe Danby stared blankly into the night. Edith Dean gazed up at the starry sky. 
 
The dog coughed hoarsely, trying to clear its throat. 
> EXAMINE DOG
It was a flea-ridden stray, with no home but the cemetery. Lodged in the throat of it was a fishbone. 
> REMOVE FISHBONE
I reached through the dog's throat and removed the fishbone. 
 
The dog yelped in panic and ran away from me, its tail tucked between its legs. 
Joe Danby said, "Don't worry, it'll come back".

I floated east and was standing beside my own grave. I could see a pebble and a new wreath. 
 
My eyes wandered absently and I found myself looking to the north, where a neat row of new headstones stood. 
Joe Danby entered from the west. David Ridge entered from the west. Edith Dean entered from the west. 
> DAVID, GET WHITE CARD
David Ridge nodded slowly. 
He took the white card. 
> PUT YELLOW CARD ON WREATH
I put the yellow card on the new wreath. 
> WAIT FOR DOG
Time passed. 
Edith Dean stared blankly into the night. A dog entered from the west. 
> GET WREATH
I would never be strong enough to carry that. 
David Ridge laughed pretentiously. The dog took the new wreath.

I hovered northwest and was in a circular clearing between the graves. I could see a twig and a broken sundial. 
Joe Danby entered from the southeast. David Ridge entered from the southeast. Edith Dean entered from the southeast.

Edith Dean hummed quietly. 
A dog entered from the southeast.

I hovered north and was beneath a copper beech. Golden leaves rustled gently in the breeze. I could see a petal and some jumbled stonework. 
Joe Danby entered from the south. David Ridge entered from the south. Edith Dean entered from the south. 
> EXAMINE STONEWORK
The jumbled stonework was, at first glance, a mass of jumbled stones. Looking closer, I could see a plinth and some carvings. 
> EXAMINE PLINTH
It was a decorated square stone base, that may once have been topped by a cross. On it was a statue. 
> HIT STATUE
I hit the statue. Slowly, it began to take the shape of a ghostly figure. 
Joe Danby grinned. "A familiar spirit, I see. Hello again, Alex". 
I watched as the figure stood up, yawned, and then brushed a few pigeon droppings off its arms. 
 
"Greetings, my friend", it announced in an elderly voice. "I am Alex Pym. Pleased to meet you". 
 
Alex Pym yawned widely. A dog entered from the south. 
> ALEX, FOLLOW ME
Alex Pym nodded obediently. 
 
The dog sniffed my leg curiously and made a puzzled noise. 
> NE
 
I floated northeast and was by the Willmot graves where a tombstone bore a double inscription under the word "reunited". I could see Bert Willmot, Edna Willmot and a green wreath. 
The company arrived from the southwest. 
 
Edna tried to snatch Bert's wreath but he wouldn't let go of it. They glared at one another in silence. 
> WAIT FOR DOG
Time passed. 
 
Bert Willmot stood guarding his wreath, while Edna paced around him, trying to it. "Let me have my wreath back", she insisted. 
 
"It's mine!", he replied, "And you're not having it". A dog entered from the southwest. 
 
"Ah, you've found Bert's wreath, though it seems that someone has mixed up the cards and put mine on it", said Edna in a satisfied tone. 
"Well, thank goodness that squabble's over with", said Bert with a sigh. "Now we might get a bit of peace and quiet around here". 
Joe Danby sniggered and muttered, "Hah! Some chance of that, Bert". 
> EDNA, FOLLOW ME
Edna Willmot nodded slowly. 
 
The dog greeted me with a wag of its tail. 
> BERT, FOLLOW ME
Bert Willmot nodded slowly. 
Edna Willmot stared pointedly into the distance. The dog wagged its tail timidly.

Time passed. 
Joe Danby floated east. A dog entered from the north. 
> PULL HANDLE
I wasn't strong enough to pull the rope. 
Joe Danby entered from the east. The dog pulled the rope handle. A small bell jingled inside the shed, the shed door swung open and the dog darted inside. It soon reappeared with the workman's lunch box, clinking with bottles and bulging with biscuits. It struggled out of the cemetery to eat its reward. 
Joe Danby laughed, "Sly little mutt!". 
> S
 
I floated south through the door and was inside the shed where the workmen kept their tools. I could see a watch, a bell, a shovel, a button, a switch and a lightbulb. 
The company arrived from outside through the door. 
> DAVID, WAIT THEN PRESS BUTTON
David Ridge nodded slowly. 
> PRESS BUTTON
I pushed the button. More pressure seemed to be needed to push it properly. 
Joe Danby tried to slink out of the door. 
David Ridge pushed the button. 
 
The button clicked to its "off" position. Looking through the shed window, I noticed that the southern part of the cemetery had become much darker. 
 
Just then, I heard a young lout bellow, "Now even the bulb's dead!" 
> GET BELL
I took the bell. 
> PRESS SWITCH
I pushed the switch. The shed light came on. 
 
The sudden shock of the light stabbed through me. I felt myself fade and everything returned to darkness. I opened my eyes and found myself back upon my own grave. 
 
Suddenly, I heard a young vandal shout, "Quick! Somebody's in the shed!" 
Then another replied, "Come on, let's leg it over this wall!" 
 
Soon after, I heard footsteps running alongside the burnt church and the sound of them scrambling jumping over the wall. "Stone me!", yelled one of them, "I nearly knocked the wall over". 
"Be quiet!", bellowed another at the top of his voice. 
 
Soon, their footsteps faded into the distance as they ran from the cemetery. 
The company arrived from the north.

The company arrived from the northwest. 
 
I hovered northwest and was in a circular clearing between the graves. I could see Colonel Rycroft, a twig and a broken sundial.

The company arrived from the east. 
 
I drifted west and was among an untidy group of old tombstones. 
The company arrived from the east. 
 
I floated west and was by the headstone of Violet Conway, beside the hedge. I could see Violet Conway and a dogwood bush. 
The company arrived from the east. 
 
Violet Conway leaned against her headstone, sorrowfully. "Oh, I wish I'd been healthier before my death", she sighed, "It's terrible having to spend my afterlife without eyes". 
> PUT BELL ON BUSH
I put the bell on the dogwood bush. "Oh, what a clever idea, young man", said Violet with a little smile. "I can hear the bell nicely when the wind blows". 
 
She got up from her grave and walked steadily towards me, "Now I can get about the place without becoming lost", she said with delight, "How ever can I thank you?".

Violet Conway nodded obediently.

He muttered about the youth of today. 
> PUSH WALL
I pushed the crumbling abbey wall. A light breeze seemed to blow against the thermometer. 
Joe Danby pushed the crumbling abbey wall. The thermometer groaned quietly in the breeze. 
Bert Willmot pushed the crumbling abbey wall. I could feel a strong breeze blowing against the thermometer. 
Edna Willmot pushed the crumbling abbey wall. The breeze turned to a wind and spread itself over the wall. 
David Ridge stood pompously with his hands on his hips. He pushed the crumbling abbey wall. Dust and loose chippings blew into the air along the wall. 
Alex Pym pushed the crumbling abbey wall. The thermometer leaned heavily and the wall began to crumble. 
Edith Dean pushed the crumbling abbey wall. A strong gale blew the wall until it leaned heavily. 
Colonel Rycroft pushed the crumbling abbey wall. The increasing blast set the wall a-quiver, almost bringing it to collapse. 
Violet Conway pushed the crumbling abbey wall. 
 
Finally, the wall could resist the wind's torment no longer, and it began to topple over. Like a tidal wave crashing along a shore, the collapse spread further and further south along the course of the wall, until at last the southernmost section smashed heavily onto the vault. 
 
We all cheered as the vault was buried beneath an avalanche of rubble, trapping the drugs hoard within it. Now the gangsters would be delayed for a day or two, until enough of the debris was cleared for them to be able to sneak back and recover their loot. It would give me time to track down their hideout, and perhaps tomorrow I would be be strong enough in spirit to leave the churchyard and do it. 
 
I could do nothing more today, for the night was now coming to an end, and it was time for us ghosts to make our way back to our graves. 
 
I had scored 300 out of 300 and was a poltergeist. 
 
I am about to start another part of the game. Do you want to save my position first, just in case? NO
 
I am about to start another part of the game. Do you want to go ahead? YES
Play the game tape to load part 2. 
 
I woke once again beside my own grave. Darkness had fallen on my second night as a ghost and my powers had grown. I smiled as I remembered how my deeds of yesternight had delayed the gangsters, buying time tonight to locate their new hideout. Now, with my heightened senses, I could detect an old house north of the cemetery...
 
(This version allows you to use RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE to save a position in memory, and UNDO to take back bad moves).
 
I was standing beside my own grave. Through the darkness, I could make out Joe Danby's grave to the north, and to the west I saw the ruins of the church tower. 
 
The earth around my grave was slushy and wet after yesterday's storm. Fallen leaves lay soaking in the murky puddles nearby, and uprooted plants littered the ground. 
What now? N
I drifted north and was by Joe Danby's grave. It was strewn with splintered lengths of wood, rusting bolts and angle irons, cast here when the spotlit tower collapsed. I could see Joe Danby. 
 
I had little doubt that Joe's old friends would be busy this weekend, tidying up his resting place. 
 
Joe Danby greeted me with a warm smile. "Good evening", he began, "I trust you slept well. You're looking fit, all things considered. It seems that you temporary ghosts soon get stronger than us residents, so I expect you'll find you've got new powers this night. Could be that you're now able to heat and cool things. You might even be able to reach through solid objects - I've seen that done in the past. How about a wander outside the cemetery. Perhaps we'll find those crooks you were telling me about last night? You lead the way and I'll just follow on". 
What now? N
I hovered north and was among the new graves. A small path, its overgrown surface almost indistinguishable from the surrounding land, lead east through a gap in the wall. 
 
The path seemed to turn beyond the wall and head north. The village green lay there, and beyond it the chimneys of an old house stood out against the skyline. It looked strangely familiar. 
Joe Danby entered from the south. 
What now? E
I drifted east and was on a path which twisted into the foggy distance to the north. 
 
Twin beams of light briefly pierced the gloom far to the north. 
Joe Danby entered from the west. 
What now? N
I floated north and was on a winding track leading north from the cemetery towards the old village. 
 
Dank clouds of mist hovered low over the green to the north, lit occasionally by long sweeping beams from the headlights of passing cars. 
No one much lived hereabouts nowadays. Most of the old houses had long since been abandoned, as people moved down to the burgeoning town to the south. 
Joe Danby entered from the south. 
What now? N
I hovered north and was on the south part of the village green. The grass was wet beneath my feet, sodden with yesternight's rain. 
Joe Danby entered from the south. 
 
The sound of an approaching car drifted across the village green. Joe urged me on, anxious to be clear of the open space. 
What now? S
I drifted south and was on a winding track leading north from the cemetery towards the old village. 
 
Dank clouds of mist hovered low over the green to the north, lit occasionally by long sweeping beams from the headlights of passing cars. 
Joe Danby entered from the north. 
What now? WAIT
Time passed. 
What now? N
I drifted north and was on the south part of the village green. The grass was wet beneath my feet, sodden with yesternight's rain. 
Joe Danby entered from the south. 
 
The dim red tail lights of a passing car faded away into the distance. 
Joe said, "The green looks safe enough to cross now. I think we should pass over". 
What now? N
I floated north and was in the middle of the village green. The area around me had been churned into a sea of mud and deeply marked by studded footprints. Just beyond, the centre line of the football pitch reappeared on a small patch of clear grass. 
Joe Danby entered from the south. 
> N
I floated north and was on the north green. 
 
As the mist thinned out, I could clearly see an old house at the end of a tangled garden to the north. No lamps were lit there, no smoke drifted from its chimneys and no sounds escaped its dark walls. Yet there was a strong sense that it was occupied, and I felt uneasy. 
Joe Danby entered from the south. 
 
The sound of an approaching car drifted across the village green. Joe urged me on, anxious to be clear of the open space. 
> N
I hovered north and was in the front garden which must once have been well tended but was now overrun with weeds and long grass. I realised with shock that I had been here before. Though this place was now deserted, it had been the gang's old hideout. 
 
As I approached the house, I seemed to see the images of many figures, spinning in a frenzy, blurring into darkening mist. 
Joe Danby entered from the south. 
 
Joe looked around. "If I'm right", he said thoughtfully, "a tragic event has left its mark on this place. Some people can call up the past in visions; I get hints but no more. Perhaps you could concentrate and summon the past a shade better than I can. As like as not, it concerned you". 
> W
I drifted west and was in the herb garden, ruined by long neglect - its plants all strangled by dead nettles. I could see a ditch. In it was some running water. I recoiled involuntarily from the sound of the ripples. 
Joe Danby entered from the east. 
> CONCENTRATE
 
I began meditating, and saw a vision of myself approaching from the garden to the east. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
I watched the vision and saw myself burying my identity card in the garden amongst the herbs. Then, the vision cleared as my figure returned inside the house again. 
> DIG
I found a small plastic card. 
 
"Aha!", exclaimed Joe, "Some evidence! Let's see what else there is to find, before you summon the police". 
 
I seemed to lose my concentration. 
> GET CARD
I took the plastic card. 
> N
I drifted north through the door and was in the kitchen. Curling flakes of old paint and dusty chunks of crumbling plaster had collected around the skirting boards, leaving the yellowing walls mottled and peeling like dead skin. I could see a bottle of whisky, some curtains, a dispenser, a lampholder and a small switch. In the lampholder was a pearl bulb. A lone cockroach scuttled off as I entered and disappeared through a hole in the cracked lino. 
> E
I floated east through the door and was in the hall which was cold and bare and unwelcoming. I could see a directory, a telephone, a lampholder and a large switch. In the lampholder was a clear bulb. 
 
A distressing presence hit me as I entered the hall; a sudden sense of past violence. And there was a painful familiarity to it, as if that violence had concerned me. 
Joe Danby entered from outside through the door. 
> GET BULB
I took the clear bulb. I dropped the plastic card. 
> PRESS SWITCH
I pushed the large switch. The landing light came on. 
 
Luke's ghost screamed painfully as the sudden shock of the landing light cast him into limbo for the rest of the night. 
Joe smacked his hands together. "You got that spirit's measure", he said with grim pleasure. "That unholy ghost won't be back in a hurry". 
Joe Danby cringed weakly away from the landing light. 
I felt uneasy about the landing light. I dropped the clear bulb. It smashed to smithereens. 
> W
I drifted west through the door and was in the kitchen. Curling flakes of old paint and dusty chunks of crumbling plaster had collected around the skirting boards, leaving the yellowing walls mottled and peeling like dead skin. I could see a bottle of whisky, some curtains, a dispenser, a lampholder and a small switch. In the lampholder was a pearl bulb. 
Joe Danby entered from the east through the door. 
> EXAMINE DISPENSER
It was fastened to the kitchen wall. Looking at the serrated metal blade along the front edge, I remembered that I never did quite get the hang of using dispensers while I was alive. I always ended up with a torn triangle of aluminum that was never big enough to do the job. In it was some foil. 
> GET FOIL
I took the foil. 
Joe Danby drifted south through the door. 
> WAIT FOR JOE
Time passed. 
Joe Danby entered from the east through the door. 
> JOE, GET PEARL BULB
He nodded in acknowledgement. 
He took the pearl bulb. 
> PUT FOIL IN LAMPHOLDER
I put the foil in the lampholder. 
> PRESS SWITCH
I pushed the small switch. There was a loud crack as the main fuse in the house was blown. 
Joe smiled and said, "That's better. I couldn't stand those blasted lights". 
> S
I drifted south through the door and was in the herb garden, ruined by long neglect - its plants all strangled by dead nettles. I could see a ditch. In it was some running water. 
> EXAMINE DITCH
The running water was cold, dirty and wet. Even in mortal form I would have kept clear of there. Now, I felt a strange revulsion as I contemplated the moving liquid. On the running water was a branch. 
> EXAMINE BRANCH
It was a large and irregular twig, still bearing a few tired leaves. On it was a map. 
Joe Danby entered from the east. 
> FREEZE WATER
I froze the running water. 
Joe Danby floated north through the door. 
> GET MAP
I took the map. 
> WAIT FOR JOE
Time passed. 
Joe Danby entered from the east. 
> JOE, GO TO LOUNGE AND PRESS WALL
He nodded slowly. 
He hovered east. 
> E
I floated east and was in the front garden which must once have been well tended but was now overrun with weeds and long grass. I could see Joe Danby. 
He drifted inside through the door. 
> E
I hovered east and was on a thick grassy lawn. A tangled growth of ivy covered the cracking wall of the house before me, reaching high to tug at the gutters and pry beneath the roof tiles. I could see some ivy. 
An owl came upon me in a white rush, sweeping down through me, talons outstretched, to pluck a cowering field mouse from the lawn behind me. I heard a thin small cry of pain before the sound was overwhelmed by the urgent beat of powerful wings. And the silence that followed was even deeper than it had been before. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
A ghostly hand emerged from behind the ivy, waved briefly and disappeared again. This gave me a fix on the room, so that I knew the position of the chimney within the wall. 
> PRESS WALL
I put a hand through the wall behind the chimney and dislodged the piece of paper from its resting place inside. 
> W
I hovered west and was in the front garden which must once have been well tended but was now overrun with weeds and long grass. 
Joe Danby entered from inside through the door. 
> N
I found that I was now capable of passing through some solid objects! With some difficulty, I drifted north through the door and was in the hall which was cold and bare and unwelcoming. I could see an plastic card, a directory, a telephone, a lampholder and a large switch. 
Joe Danby entered from outside through the door. 
> DROP MAP
I dropped the map. 
> E
I floated east through the door and was in the lounge. Dark-stained bookcases covered one wall, but carried nothing but dust and the pale stains from careless cups. Apart from that, the place was bare of furniture. I could see a chimney piece, a fireplace and a bricked-up door. In the fireplace was a piece of paper. The room's sparseness was offset by a fine old fireplace with a carved mantle and tiled surround. I wondered idly how long it would be before some enterprising cowboy ripped it out to sell in London. 
Joe Danby entered from the west through the door. 
> GET PAPER
I took the piece of paper. 
> W
I hovered west through the door and was in the hall which was cold and bare and unwelcoming. I could see an plastic card, a map, a directory, a telephone, a lampholder and a large switch. 
Joe Danby entered from the east through the door. 
> DROP PAPER
I dropped the piece of paper. 
> EXAMINE DIRECTORY
It was just of the local area. It was the latest edition and only three years out-of-date. In it was a bookmark. 
> JOE, WAIT THEN PULL BOOKMARK
Joe Danby nodded slowly. 
> PULL BOOKMARK
I pulled the bookmark. A little more force seemed to be needed. 
Joe said, "It will take more than one ghost to do that". 
Joe Danby pulled the bookmark. 
 
"It seems to me", began Joe, "that we've almost found enough evidence to locate where the drugs gang are hiding. When we've finished, I hope you can work out how to give it all to the police". 
> U
I hovered upwards and was on the landing, overlooking a narrow staircase. A door lead into the bathroom, and a small hatch above led into the attic. I could see a grandfather clock and a fluorescent tube. On the grandfather clock was a panel. 
 
Ghostly footsteps trod clumsily behind me, as if two figures were carrying something heavy up the stairs. But this was only another echo of the past. 
Joe Danby entered from below. 
> U
I hovered upwards and was in the attic. Dusty cobwebs dangled down and passed through me. I could see a plug, a socket and a water tank. 
 
The still air seemed to shimmer. 
Joe Danby entered from below. 
> GET PLUG
I took the plug. 
> D
I drifted downwards and was on the landing, overlooking a narrow staircase. A door lead into the bathroom, and a small hatch above led into the attic. I could see a grandfather clock and a fluorescent tube. On the grandfather clock was a panel. 
Joe Danby entered from above. 
> N
I floated north through the door and was in the bathroom. I could see a mirror. 
 
The socket was dragged along the floor on the landing. 
Joe Danby entered from outside through the door. 
> SMASH MIRROR
The plug hit the mirror and smashed it to pieces, revealing a secret alcove. Someone had stashed a briefcase in there. 
 
"Well", said Joe contentedly, "I think we've collected enough evidence for the police to locate the gang. Now we'd better try and find some way to get it to them". 
> JOE, GET BRIEFCASE, S, D, DROP BRIEFCASE
Joe Danby nodded in acknowledgement. 
He took the briefcase. 
> S
I drifted south through the door and was on the landing, overlooking a narrow staircase. A door lead into the bathroom, and a small hatch above led into the attic. I could see a socket, a grandfather clock and a fluorescent tube. On the grandfather clock was a panel. 
Joe Danby entered from the north through the door. 
> U
I floated upwards and was in the attic. Dusty cobwebs dangled down and passed through me. I could see a water tank. 
> GET IN TANK
I eased myself into the tank and then realised to my horror that I was not alone there. Swaying eerily in the discoloured water was the dead body of Luke, the crook I had shot in the struggle before my death. 
 
Startled by the gruesome sight, I scrambled to get out of the tank, pushing aside the lid in my panic. 
> GET IN TANK
I got in the water tank. 
> FREEZE PLUG TO BODY
I froze the plug to the dead body. 
Joe Danby entered from below. 
> D
I drifted downwards and was on the landing, overlooking a narrow staircase. A door lead into the bathroom, and a small hatch above led into the attic. I could see a socket, a grandfather clock and a fluorescent tube. On the grandfather clock was a panel. 
Joe Danby entered from above. 
> OPEN PANEL
I opened the panel. 
Joe Danby floated inside through the door. 
> GET SOCKET
I took the socket. 
Joe Danby entered from inside through the door. 
> PUT SOCKET IN PANEL
I put the socket behind the panel. 
> CLOSE PANEL
I closed the panel. 
> PUSH CLOCK
I pushed the grandfather clock. The clock toppled over and slid heavily down the stairs to the hall. 
"Timber!" Shouted Joe, enjoying his night's work. The dead body was dragged along behind it. 
> D
I hovered downwards and was in the hall which was cold and bare and unwelcoming. I could see an plastic card, a piece of paper, a map, a bookmark, a briefcase, a directory, a dead body, a grandfather clock, a telephone, a lampholder and a large switch. On the grandfather clock was a panel. 
Joe Danby entered from above. 
> W
Did you know that you can go quickly to a far off place? E.G "RUN TO HALL" or "GOTO JOE". 
I drifted west through the door and was in the kitchen. Curling flakes of old paint and dusty chunks of crumbling plaster had collected around the skirting boards, leaving the yellowing walls mottled and peeling like dead skin. I could see a bottle of whisky, some curtains, a dispenser, a lampholder and a small switch. In the lampholder was some foil. 
Joe Danby entered from the east through the door. 
> PUSH BOTTLE
I pushed over the bottle, which smashed open on the floor. The whisky spread in a widening pool and began to evaporate. It wasn't long before the room was filled with its strong vapour. 
"Hey!", Joe, "What a terrible waste". 
Joe Danby made a quiet murmuring sound. 
> LIGHT PUDDLE
I ignited the cloud of whisky vapour. 
 
The whisky vapour flashed into a flickering blue-white fire. 
> PULL CURTAINS
I blew the curtains into the flames where the crisp fabric instantly caught fire. 
Joe gaped at me, "I see you are determined to experience death warmed up". 
 
Thick smoke began to fill the house. 
"You'll have the fire brigade around", tutted Joe. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
The house was filled with dense acrid smoke and the roar of flames. Then the wailing sound of an approaching siren came through above the noise of the fire. There was a screech of brakes and a rush of heavy footsteps as a fire engine pulled up outside and a group of firemen ran up to the house. They smashed their way in through the front door and dashed into the kitchen, shouting orders to the others outside. 
 
"Someone radio for the police!", shouted a fireman in the hall. "There's a dead man here and he wasn't killed by the fire. Don't touch anything". I was sure that Luke's body would stir the police into action, and that when they looked at the evidence I had collected, they would have sufficient clues to locate the drugs gang. I had done my job. 
 
I had scored 600 out of 600 and was a poltergeist.

Welcome to part 3 of Scapeghost, copyright (C) 1989 from Level 9 Computing. 
 
I awoke abruptly at the start of my third night, feeling stronger than ever and wondering if I would be able to achieve such feats as bending metal and manifesting myself to mortals. 
 
With a shock, I noticed a priest kneeling before my grave, mumbling passages from a leather-bound book. Two men stood over him. I thought at first they were some kind of assistants, until I saw through their disguises and recognised them as members of the drugs gang. They weren't helping him. They were making sure he did what he was told.. 
 
(This version allows you to use RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE to save a position in memory, and UNDO to take back bad moves).
 
I was overlooking my own grave. It was difficult to see anything to the north, as that part of the cemetery seemed somehow drained of colour and form. To the west, a path led towards the pile of rubble that had once been the abbey wall. I could see the priest, Big John and Weasel. 
 
The priest made the sign of a cross, his eyes raised blankly towards heaven. Beside him, the villain that they called Weasel rubbed his hands together in evil satisfaction. 
"Get a move on", John urged the priest. "We all dreamed of Luke last night, and he warned us that the ghost of this one was still walking. Let's get the holy water business over with". 
What now? W
I drifted west and was on a path of stone chippings, running east-west between my grave and the rubble of the wall. A second path led off to the south through a scattering of fallen stones. 
 
I sensed that if I returned to my exorcised grave I would be banished forever. It would be the same if I returned as a free spirit or if I were cast there by sudden light. I would have to be very careful on this last night as a ghost... 
What now? S
I floated south and was on a path leading south out of the cemetery. The church wall had collapsed into a great pile of rubble that was strewn across the graveyard, though much of the debris had by now been cleared. I could see some rubble. 
 
I felt a twinge of guilt about the damage that I had created, even though it had been in a good cause. 
 
The priest ran past me in a panic as I heard the cruel laughter of John and Weasel coming from my grave. 
What now? S
I drifted south and was at a junction in the path. The ruins of the church lay to the northwest and a narrow path led east towards the gate to the car park. I could see a collapsed vault. Though there was no sign of Joe that night, I thought I heard him saying, "Good luck and happy haunting". 
 
I would need all the luck going, if I were going to slow down the gangsters. 
What now? E
I drifted east and was outside the cemetery gate where there was a small car park. I could see a van. 
What now? GET IN VAN
I got in the van. 
What now? WAIT FOR WEASEL
Time passed. 
Big John entered from the west. Weasel entered from the west. 
What now? WAIT 3
Time passed. 
Big John got in the van. Weasel got in the van. 
 
Weasel started the engine and said, "Right, let's be off then". 
Weasel narrowed his eyes. He drove for miles through the damp and dismal countryside, while I hid in the shadows at the back of the van. At last, we began to slow down... 
 
The van was at a junction. A narrow track split off from the main north-south road and disappeared into the darkness to the west. 
 
Drizzle began to patter lightly on the roof of the van. 
 
"Bit of a rough night, Weasel", moaned John. "Better not get one of those blasted power cuts at the farm tonight". 
What now? GET OUT OF VAN
I got out. 
Weasel drove the van west. 
What now? W
I hovered west and was on a narrow dirt track. I could see a farmhouse ahead of me to the west. The junction with the road, to the east, was lost in the dark. I could see a van. 
 
I knew where we were now; this was the track I had seen on the criminals' map. Obviously they were still using their new hideout, which meant that the police had not yet closed in, and that I still had work to do... 
Weasel drove the van west. 
A haunting breeze carried away the "What now" prompts. 
> W
I drifted west and was in the farmyard outside a small stone farmhouse. A ramshackle old barn stood to the west, from which scatterings of straw were strewn all the way to the track on the east. A small passage ran northeast to the side of the house. I could see a van. 
 
The farm stood on a small hill, with views of the countryside all around. The rain would help restrict visibility, but if the police were to have a chance of closing in without being seen, I would have to help. Otherwise, the evidence would all be destroyed before they got here. 
 
"Park the van in the barn", said John. "And make sure it's facing out in case we need to do a runner". 
> W
I hovered west and was in the front of the barn at the western edge of the farmyard. The ground inside was thick with dung and sodden straw. I could see some hay. 
 
A dull glimmer caught my eye for a moment, but I couldn't see anything when I looked again. I guessed I must have frightened a rat, but there bigger rats around the place that needed my attention more. 
Weasel drove the van from the east. 
> EXAMINE HAY
The hay was damp and full of fungus tendrils. In the hay was an insecticide sprayer. 
Big John got out. Weasel got out. 
> GET SPRAYER
I took the insecticide sprayer. 
Big John walked east. Weasel trudged east. 
> E
I hovered east and was in the farmyard outside a small stone farmhouse. A ramshackle old barn stood to the west, from which scatterings of straw were strewn all the way to the track on the east. A small passage ran northeast to the side of the house. I could see Big John and Weasel. 
Big John walked inside through the door. Weasel trudged inside through the door. 
> NE
I floated northeast and was by the side of the farmhouse, where stood a small stone-built outhouse. A concrete path carried on northwards around the back of the house. The long shadow of the farmhouse made it difficult to see much along that side. 
> N
I floated north and was at the back of the house. Thick clumps of nettles and weeds thrust upwards between the paving stones and the wall. Behind them, two thick electricity supply cables emerged from the house. I could see some connectors and some wires. 
 
The insulation on the connectors had crumbled away, leaving them dangerously exposed. 
> TOUCH SPRAYER ON CONNECTORS
I touched the sprayer on the connectors and there was a swift shower of crisp blue sparks and a sharp crack as I shorted out the electricity supply to the house. 
> S
I hovered south and was by the side of the farmhouse, where stood a small stone-built outhouse. A concrete path carried on northwards around the back of the house. I could see John. 
 
John cursed the electricity board vigorously, and went into the outhouse to start the backup generator. 
"Ruddy thing's knackered", he complained as he reappeared. "It's only giving out sixty flamin' volts". John walked southwest. 
> SW
I drifted southwest and was in the farmyard outside a small stone farmhouse. A ramshackle old barn stood to the west, from which scatterings of straw were strewn all the way to the track on the east. A small passage ran northeast to the side of the house. I could see John. 
He stomped inside through the door. 
> N
I floated north through the door and was in the hallway. It was a cold room with a hard quarry tiled floor. Stairways led up and down from here, and there were two doors. The one to the east had "Kitchen" carved on the ornamented woodwork above it. The one to the north was marked in discriminatory fashion, "Living Room". I could see John and a cupboard. 
 
The electricity supply to the house now came from the ancient generator outside, so the lights only glowed dimly. 
 
I realised that my powers had grown since the previous night, and that now I had the power to charge things with static, and to manifest myself if I wished. 
John coughed loudly. He stomped east through the door. 
> EXAMINE CUPBOARD
It was a walk-in wardrobe, that may have been used for storing brooms and coats but was now bare. In it was a circuit breaker. 
> PUSH BREAKER
I switched off the circuit breaker. 
> U
I floated upwards and was at the top of the stairs next to the bathroom door. A narrow corridor hung with cheap prints led off northwards to the bedrooms, and a small hatch above gave access to the attic. I could see a creaky stair. I glanced at the prints. They were of thatched cottages, horse-drawn ploughs, bright clean farmyards - and always the sun shone gaily and the people were tanned and smiling. Country-living as it never was. 
> U
I drifted upwards and was in the attic which had been converted into a small bed-sitting room. At its western end there was a low bed beneath a small window. Tiny motes of dust danced lazily in the moonbeams that shone through the window. 
> W
I hovered west and was in the attic bedroom. A small single bed had been pushed hard up against the wall. I could see a whisky flask, a window, some curtains and a lampholder. 
 
I looked through the window with concern. I felt sure that my colleagues would soon have puzzled out the clues that I had left for them. But the window overlooked several points on the main road to the farm, and anyone sitting here would be sure to see the police coming. Unless he was distracted, of course, and I somehow knew that I would have to do this five times... 
> EXAMINE LAMPHOLDER
It was hanging from the ceiling on a twisted flex. In it was a bulb. 
> WAIT FOR BIG JOHN
Time passed. 
Big John entered from the east. Big John looked straight through me and squinted slightly. 
 
He sat down on the bed next to the window and opened his flask of whisky. "Well, at least I won't be losing all my money to John when he plays poker", he sighed. "I can get sloshed in peace up here". 
> GET BULB
I took the bulb. I dropped the insecticide sprayer. The attic was then much darker, lit only by the light that came through the window. "Not another power cut", groaned John. 
> WAIT
I waited patiently for a while, and then noticed something going on outside the window... 
 
Big John took his copy of "The Beano" out his pocket and began to read it. "Gosh!", he exclaimed, "Isn't Dennis being naughty this week". 
 
Looking through the window, I noticed a series of flashing lights in the nearby village. 
> THROW BULB
I dropped the bulb. It smashed to smithereens. "Whassat!", snapped John as he heard the bulb smash. Nervously, he looked away from the window and so didn't see the signs of the police approaching. 
Big John narrowed his eyes. 
 
John scratched his head in frustration. "Dunno what it is about this place", he said, shaking his head. "But it sure gives me the willies". 
> GET GLASS
I took the broken glass. 
 
John shone his torch around the room, thinking that the other members of the gang were playing tricks on him. "Come on, I can see you", he shouted, although he couldn't see anyone at all. "It's not funny, y'know".

Time passed. 
 
John put his torch down and sat back on the bed, slightly more at ease. "Must be the gang takin' the Mick", he said. "Well, they won't scare me easily". 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
Big John began to pour whisky down his throat like there was no tomorrow. "Sheesh!", he wheezed as he took the flask from his mouth, "Fiery stuff, that". 
> WAIT
I waited patiently for a while, and then noticed something going on outside the window... 
 
From the window, I saw the lights of a fleet of cars leaving the centre of the village. It looked like the police were now on their way. 
> BLOW CURTAIN
I blew the curtains. The curtains wafted into the room and John stared at them uneasily. Nervously, he looked away from the window and so didn't see the signs of the police approaching. 
Big John coughed loudly. 
 
John leapt into bed and pulled up the covers until only his eyes were visible. "This attic is haunted", he said in a muffled voice. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
John climbed hesitantly out of the bed and paced across the attic towards the hatch. "No, I can't do that", he said as he got half way across the room. "If I tell the others they'll just laugh in my face". 
He paced reluctantly back to the bed and sat down, shivering. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
"It must be the booze", decided John. "I've been drinking steady ever since I came up here. No wonder I'm seeing things". 
He took another swig of whisky from his flask, to calm himself down. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Big John narrowed his eyes. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
Big John flicked through his Beano with excitement, as if trying to find something. "Yeah!", he shouted, "The Bash Street kids! I wonder what teach' is going to get up to this week...". 
> WAIT
I waited patiently for a while, and then noticed something going on outside the window... 
 
I caught a glimpse of some cars passing over a nearby hill. A number of them disappeared back into the valley, but one of them parked by the side of the road. 
> E
I hovered east and was in the attic which had been converted into a small bed-sitting room. At its western end there was a low bed beneath a small window. 
> D
I drifted downwards and was at the top of the stairs next to the bathroom door. A narrow corridor hung with cheap prints led off northwards to the bedrooms, and a small hatch above gave access to the attic. I could see a creaky stair. 
> PULL STAIR
I pulled the creaky stair. The stair creaked eerily and I heard Big John let out a nervous whine. "T-there's s-something creepy going on here", he stammered. 
> D
I hovered downwards and was in the hallway. It was a cold room with a hard quarry tiled floor. Stairways led up and down from here, and there were two doors. The one to the east had "Kitchen" carved on the ornamented woodwork above it. The one to the north was marked in discriminatory fashion, "Living Room". I could see a cupboard. 
> D
I drifted downwards and was on a flight of steps cut into the stone foundations of the house and leading down into a dank basement. I could see a heavy oak door. In it was a window. 
 
Droplets of icy water dripped from the ceiling and splashed onto the steps, making patterns in the dust. 
> WAIT FOR WEASEL
Time passed. 
Weasel entered from above. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Weasel opened the heavy oak door. 
> IN
I floated inside through the door and was in a large cellar which stretched to the north beneath a low ceiling. I could see a shelf and a heavy oak door. In it was a window. 
Weasel entered from outside through the door. 
> N
I hovered north and was in the back of the cellar. I could see a chair and a hammer. On the chair was Sarah. 
Weasel entered from the south. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
"Just checking you're still here", said Weasel to Sarah. "If you want anything to eat, just give me a shout and I'll ignore you", he sniggered. 
Sarah glared at him and cursed vigorously behind her gag. Weasel trudged south. 
> MANIFEST
I concentrated my ghostly powers and manifested myself. Sarah's eyes widened and she let out a muffled shriek. As the initial shock wore off, she realised who I was and her expression slowly changed from fear to amazement. Soon, when she had calmed down, she sat still, hoping that I would cut the ropes. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> CUT ROPES
I cut the ropes and the gag with the glass, freeing Sarah. 
 
"I don't know how you managed to return from the dead", she whispered with a shudder, "but I never thought I'd be glad to see a ghost. Thank you for freeing me". 
She ran over to the cellar door and balanced a hammer on the shelf above it, before returning to her previous position on the chair. 
"You know what to do when Weasel returns", she said with a tight smile, tossing the bonds back over her as if she were still tied up. 
> S
I drifted south and was in a large cellar which stretched to the north beneath a low ceiling. I could see a shelf and a heavy oak door. In it was a window. On the shelf was a hammer. 
> WAIT FOR WEASEL
Time passed. 
The door opened from the other side. 
Weasel entered from outside through the door. 
 
In the presence of hostile humans, I became invisible once again. 
> PUSH HAMMER
I pushed the heavy hammer off the shelf. 
 
It hit Weasel smack on the back of the head, knocking him flat out on the floor. 
> MANIFEST
I concentrated my ghostly powers and manifested myself. 
Sarah entered from the north. 
> SARAH, TIE WEASEL
She nodded obediently. 
She looked around. Sarah bound and gagged Weasel, finishing just as he began to wake up. 
> OUT
I floated outside through the door and was on a flight of steps cut into the stone foundations of the house and leading down into a dank basement. I could see a heavy oak door. In it was a window. 
Sarah entered from inside through the door. She bolted the cellar door securely on her way out. 
> U
I hovered upwards and was in the hallway. It was a cold room with a hard quarry tiled floor. Stairways led up and down from here, and there were two doors. The one to the east had "Kitchen" carved on the ornamented woodwork above it. The one to the north was marked in discriminatory fashion, "Living Room". I could see a cupboard. 
Sarah entered from below. 
 
"Maybe I'd better find somewhere to hide", said Sarah, her eyes exploring the hallway. 
> GO TO BARN
I floated outside through the door and was in the farmyard outside a small stone farmhouse. A ramshackle old barn stood to the west, from which scatterings of straw were strewn all the way to the track on the east. A small passage ran northeast to the side of the house. 
Sarah entered from inside through the door. 
> SARAH, GO TO TAXI, DEFLATE TYRES
Sarah nodded obediently. 
She looked around. She trudged west. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Sarah entered from the west. 
> SARAH, GO TO CUPBOARD, HIDE IN IT, WAIT 20
Sarah nodded in acknowledgement. 
She trudged inside through the door. 
> GO TO ATTIC
I hovered inside through the door and was in the hallway. I could see Sarah and a cupboard. 
Sarah hid in the cupboard. 
I floated upwards and was at the top of the stairs. I could see a creaky stair. 
I hovered upwards and was in the attic. 
I floated west and was in the attic bedroom. A small single bed had been pushed hard up against the wall. I could see Big John, a whisky flask, an insecticide sprayer, a window, some curtains and a lampholder. 
 
In the presence of hostile humans, I became invisible once again. 
 
Big John began to pour whisky down his throat like there was no tomorrow. "Sheesh!", he wheezed as he took the flask from his mouth, "Fiery stuff, that". 
 
John took a brief look out of the window, but he didn't appear to have seen the police yet. 
> FREEZE JOHN
I cooled Big John. John clasped his arms around himself, shivering in the sudden cold. He sat on the edge of his bed, eyes darting nervously around the attic. Nervously, he looked away from the window and so didn't see the signs of the police approaching. 
 
John shrieked and darted into the bed, pulling the covers up to his twitching eyes. 
> FREEZE JOHN
I cooled Big John. "It gets colder by the minute", said John, rubbing his hands together. "Well I know one way to keep out the chill of the night", he added and took a warming swig of whisky. 
 
John lay trembling in the bed, cautiously edging back the covers with his quivering hands. 
> FREEZE JOHN
I cooled Big John. "It gets colder by the minute", said John, rubbing his hands together. "Well I know one way to keep out the chill of the night", he added and took a warming swig of whisky. 
 
John climbed hesitantly out of the bed and wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. 
"Pull yourself together", he said to himself, "It's probably just the wind outside". 
Having reassured himself a little, he lay back on the bed and tried to calm down again. 
> MANIFEST
I concentrated my ghostly powers and manifested myself. 
 
John fixed his eyes on me and screamed, firing off the full magazine of his gun through me. The gang must have thought that they were under attack and I heard them running from the kitchen, to see what was going on. 
> E
I floated east and was in the attic which had been converted into a small bed-sitting room. At its western end there was a low bed beneath a small window. 
> D
I hovered downwards and was at the top of the stairs next to the bathroom door. A narrow corridor hung with cheap prints led off northwards to the bedrooms, and a small hatch above gave access to the attic. I could see a creaky stair. 
John entered from below. 
 
In the presence of hostile humans, I became invisible once again. Jude entered from below. Severian entered from below. 
> D
I hovered downwards and was in the hallway. It was a cold room with a hard quarry tiled floor. Stairways led up and down from here, and there were two doors. The one to the east had "Kitchen" carved on the ornamented woodwork above it. The one to the north was marked in discriminatory fashion, "Living Room". I could see a cupboard. 
> MANIFEST
I concentrated my ghostly powers and manifested myself. Sarah watched me closely, waiting for me to say something. 
> SARAH, E, GET BRIEFCASE, W
Sarah nodded obediently. 
She ran east through the door. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Sarah entered from the east through the door. 
> SARAH, HIDE IN CUPBOARD, WAIT 20
Sarah nodded in acknowledgement. 
She sighed. She hid in the cupboard. 
> GO TO VAN
I floated outside through the door and was in the farmyard. 
I hovered west and was in the front of the barn at the western edge of the farmyard. The ground inside was thick with dung and sodden straw. I could see some hay and a van. 
 
With a boost of confidence, I had the feeling that the police were now on their way. 
> LET DOWN TYRES
I deflated the tyres them. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Big John entered from the east. 
 
In the presence of hostile humans, I became invisible once again. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Big John narrowed his eyes. He kicked the tyres impatiently and said, "We don't have time to inflate those. Let's go! Just drive the damn thing carefully". He got in the van. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
"Blast!", cursed Big John. "John's got the van key with him. Where the hell's he got to?". Severian entered from the east. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Severian hurried west. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
A feeling of satisfaction coursed through me as I realised that the police should be hot on the trail of the crooks by now. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Weasel entered from the east. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
John entered from the east. Weasel got in the van. Jude entered from the east. 
> BEND KEY
I bent the key. John felt the movement in his pocket and guessed that Jude was feeling friendly. He casually put his hand on her knee and was taken aback when she pulled it away and hissed, "Not now". 
John got in the van. Jude got in the van. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
 
"Okay, let's hit the road", said John as he fumbled in his pocket for his ignition key. 
 
"Hell and Damnation!", stormed John as he took the bent key from his pocket. "Come on! I haven't got time to straighten the damn thing. Leg it across the fields before the Bill catch us. 
 
Unfortunately for the drug traffickers, the police had the farm surrounded, making the gang easy prey. 
> GO TO BARN
 
The wail of a distant siren drifted faintly through the air and then faded again. It seemed like it wouldn't be long before the police would be here. 
I hovered east and was in the farmyard outside a small stone farmhouse. A ramshackle old barn stood to the west, from which scatterings of straw were strewn all the way to the track on the east. A small passage ran northeast to the side of the house. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Severian drove the taxi from the west. 
> GET INTO TAXI
I got in the taxi. 
Severian sighed impatiently. He drove the taxi south. 
The taxi was on a muddy track, running from the farmyard, south-east across a grassy field. Other fields lay to the east and west beyond low hedges of thorn. 
> MANIFEST
I concentrated my ghostly powers and manifested myself. Severian appeared to have seen me, but just seemed to avoid me. 
 
In a last attempt to stop the buyers from getting away, I made myself visible and tried to overcome Severian, who was driving. He fought back, waving his arms about in a frenzy. The taxi began to career madly all over the track. The flat tyres had made it difficult to drive anyway, now it went completely out of control. 
 
The taxi skidded off the side of the track and crashed into a tree. Severian and the Professor struggled free of the wreck, moments before it burst into flames. Bruised and shaken, they made a run for it across the fields. 
 
Unfortunately for them, the police were close by, and soon had them caught and cuffed. 
 
Epilogue... 
 
I had succeeded in bringing John Q and the other drug smugglers to justice. And as for the buyers, Severian and the Professor, they were caught, with the drugs being available as evidence - irrefutable proof of their guilt. 
Sarah was still alive and gave evidence to the police to clear my name. 
 
Knowing that my work was done, I returned at peace to the spirit world. My three days on earth were at an end, and I ascended triumphally to Heaven. 
 
I had scored 1000 out of 1000 and was a poltergeist. 
The adventure had come to an end.
