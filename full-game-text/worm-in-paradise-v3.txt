Unfortunately this has temporary negative availability status. Presumably you wish to try a YTS course like everyone else?" NO
The droid says, "How about taking advantage of the government's on-going post-school education policy and broadening your mind on a YOP course?" NO
The droid recites its next question, "Do you really need to experience work today?" YES
The droid says, "Are you quite sure?" YES
The droid says, "OK, I'll have a look". It rummages under the counter for a while, then reappears and says: "What about being a clerk? That would put you on the first rung of the bureaucracy and perhaps after a decade or two working you might even be allowed to join the Party?" NO
The droid says, "What about being a common labourer?" NO
The droid says, "Sorry, I have no more jobs. Come back tomorrow". It shakes your hand limply as you turn away. Then its voice changes. "Oops, my mistake, there is one trivial little job I forgot. How about being managing director of Enoch's direct labour organisation?" YES
