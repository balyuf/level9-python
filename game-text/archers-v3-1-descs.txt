0x019b  /  0x1c56 (0x002d)  : I tell Higgs to exercise Captain. I say, "Make sure he doesn't sit down and sleep." Higgs says, "Don't you worry about that." 
0x019c  /  0x1c84 (0x0019)  : a terrible thing! Higgs has dragged Captain behind his bicycle for 10 miles! 
0x019d  /  0x1c9e (0x001d)  : the phones have been jammed by animal lovers, protesting about Higgs' appalling treatment of Captain!

0x01a8  /  0x1cf4 (0x001a)  : . All Captain needs is exercise and discipline. A British answer for a British dog.

0x01aa  /  0x1d17 (0x001a)  : . Lambert has been ill tempered ever since Shula Archer refused to marry him. 
0x01b8  /  0x1d33 (0x0034)  : I call in Mr Ruff from Hollerton Pet Parlour. He says bull terriers are sensitive, emotional, and easily disturbed. Captain sleeps to avoid the sadness of life.

0x01ba  /  0x1d6e (0x0002)  : .

0x01bc  /  0x1d7a (0x0036)  : . It is Royal Stuart tartan. He wags his tail when I put it on him. He scampers round the study wagging his tail some more. Then he goes to sleep. 
0x01bd  /  0x1db1 (0x000c)  : ask Mr Ruff for a course of vitamins
0x01be  /  0x1dbe (0x0043)  : . He says, "Good idea," and charges #50. Captain refuses to eat them, but gobbles up everything else in sight. While he is eating he is not sleeping. It is a good sign. 
0x01cc  /  0x1e04 (0x002f)  : Captain gets fatter and fatter. He bursts the ribbons of his new Royal Stuart dog coat. He tries to jump on my duvet and rolls over backwards. 
0x01cd  /  0x1e34 (0x0006)  : take him to dog training
0x01ce  /  0x1e3b (0x0056)  :  sessions in Borchester. A big woman says, "An obedient dog is a happy dog! A fit dog is a happy dog! A slim dog is a healthy dog!" Captain whines piteously. The big woman says, "We'll soon cure you of that, Roly Poly!"

0x01e0  /  0x1f3a (0x0036)  : Captain is outraged. I can see it in his eyes. Staffordshire bull terriers do not like being called Roly Poly by Big Women. Even a strict diet would be better! 
0x01e1  /  0x1f71 (0x0006)  : heed Peggy's words
0x01e2  /  0x1f78 (0x001b)  : . I know that Ruff is a villain and Captain is overfed. I must behave sensibly.

0x01e6  /  0x1fda (0x0042)  : for the rest of the week. She says, "I was only telling you for your own good." Captain enjoys his chicken and Mr Ruff says he is recovering his spirits. I wish we had discovered Mr Ruff years ago. 
0x01f4  /  0x201f (0x003c)  : the village shop is losing money! My accountant says Martha is slow and expensive. I say, "Just like British Rail!" And have a good laugh. My accountant says it is not a laughing matter.

0x01f6  /  0x2064 (0x0027)  :  and advertise a "grand opening." Eddie Grundy offers to make a personal appearance and sing his greatest hit records.

0x01f8  /  0x2093 (0x0052)  :  unless she makes a profit. She cries and sobs, "Oh that it should come to this!" I tell her of the chill winds gusting through British Industry. She must either pull up her socks or get on her bike. She might even have to do both!

0x01fa  /  0x20ef (0x004c)  : . I put an advert in Exchange and Mart. Martha cries and sobs and says, "O what will happen to me?" I say, "Why, the workhouse, Martha, the workhouse!" And laugh. Martha bursts into tears.

0x020b  /  0x2179 (0x002b)  : . Several people look at Martha, and go away again. One man makes her do an adding-up test. She scores 7 out of 20. 
0x020c  /  0x21a5 (0x0007)  : explain the Capitalist ethos
0x020d  /  0x21ad (0x001a)  :  to Martha. Soon she realises she is fired. She sobs and runs away.

0x0222  /  0x228e (0x0008)  : decide not to sell the shop
0x0223  /  0x2297 (0x001e)  : . It is a useful tax loss. I have my seat on the parish council to think of. 
0x0224  /  0x22b6 (0x001d)  : I liked the story about selling the shop. You could perhaps have kept it going for longer. 
0x0230  /  0x22d5 (0x002e)  : I offer Eddie Grundy #5 personal appearance fee. He says, "Get lost. Who do you think I am, Wayne Tucson?"

0x0233  /  0x2315 (0x0061)  : nobody turns up for the grand opening except for Eddie's family, Clarrie, Joe, Little William and Little Edward. Between them they eat two jam swiss rolls and drink several glasses of orange squash. Eddie insists on singing even though there's nobody there. I tell Martha I will have to sell the shop.

0x0238  /  0x23ab (0x0041)  : Jennifer says Katie was flattered but isn't free until June. I say, "There's fifty quid in notes waiting if she can make it this Saturday." Jennifer says I'm out of touch with the glittering celebrity world. 
0x0244  /  0x23ef (0x003c)  : Martha agrees to open at 8am and stay open till 6pm. She offers to chop kindling every weekend and sell it at 50p a bundle. I say, "That's the spirit, Martha!" 
0x0245  /  0x242c (0x0022)  : Chief Petty Officer Curlew phones from Portsmouth. He wants to buy the shop! I invite him to lunch. 
0x0246  /  0x244f (0x0061)  : Chief Petty Officer Curlew has come to buy the shop. I offer him a pink gin and say, "Splice the Mainbrace!"

0x0247  /  0x24b2 (0x002d)  : Martha changes her mind about working at Grey Gables. She says all her customers in the village would miss her. She pleads with me to let her stay at the shop. 
0x0258  /  0x24e1 (0x000d)  : Peggy tells me the entire village is in revolt.

0x026c  /  0x2582 (0x007f)  : I come from a humble home in Stirchley. When I was thirteen I sold newspapers at New Street Station. It was very cold at the University of Life and sometimes I was hungry. But I worked hard and made my way in the world. Now I am the owner of Grey Gables and the Borchester Echo. I give generously to Conservative Party Funds. Why is it that I have never featured in the New Year's Honours List?

0x0272  /  0x2665 (0x004b)  : . I tell Constituency chairman Admiral Banks that the PM can expect a substantial donation to the fighting fund. Admiral Banks looks startled. "If you're feeling flush," he says, "how about a new billiard table for the Churchill Club?" 
0x0273  /  0x26b2 (0x0028)  : I'm getting complaints from Conservative Central office. They say your story about paying for honours is another example of BBC left-wing bias. 
0x0280  /  0x26dc (0x00a5)  : Admiral Banks comes to lunch. He says, "Large G and T, Woolley, quick as you like." Caroline says he is treating me like one of the Establishment. I wonder if I am being treated like a waiter. I fetch the gin and tonic. The Admiral calls Margaret Thatcher "Our Leader." Over hot lobster, Admiral Banks asks for a Tombola prize for the Association dinner dance. I grab a litre of Glenfiddich from the bar. The Admiral says, "Good chap, Woolley." Caroline says he will swig it himself. 
0x0281  /  0x2784 (0x0010)  : I have nobody to take to the Conservative Association dance.

0x0294  /  0x2805 (0x0060)  : I ask Caroline for clothes advice. She is a Bohun, descended from Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. She is related by marriage to the Duke of Westminster. She says my white tuxedo with silver braid is very smart. I tell Peggy. She says the aristocracy speak in coded language, like the Chinese. 
0x0295  /  0x2867 (0x000d)  : wear my white tuxedo with my lilac shirt
0x0296  /  0x2875 (0x000a)  :  and midnight blue cummerbund.

0x029b  /  0x28df (0x0025)  : the dance is not a success. The admiral's wife says I remind her of Bob Monkhouse. Peggy pretends she is not with me. 
0x02a8  /  0x2906 (0x0043)  : Peggy rushes in, looking upset. "Was it wise, Jack? At your age?" She says the village is alive with rumours that I took Dolly Treadgold to the Forrester's Supper at Hollerton Free Trade Hall.

0x02ae  /  0x29a2 (0x0034)  : . Peggy says, "Don't be ridiculous. Fourteen people, including Tom Forrest and Martha, saw you doing the Birdie Dance at 1am in Hollerton Market Square."

0x02d3  /  0x2a5c (0x0042)  : . He claims the wine stain on the right lapel is bird droppings. He says chaffinches eat blackberries and their droppings are red coloured. Caroline says, "Where did they get blackberries at this time of year?"

0x02d5  /  0x2aa7 (0x0034)  :  of stealing my white tuxedo from the scarecrow and escorting Dolly Treadgold to the Forrester's Dance. I give him a fiver. It's the best laugh I've had in weeks.
