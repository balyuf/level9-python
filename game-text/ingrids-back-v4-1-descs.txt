0x0259  /  0x1808 (0x0030)  : incorrigible, indefatigable and in the Dribble Valley. And if it hadn't been uphill all the way out, more gnomes might have gone to stay with distant relatives until she left again
0x025a  /  0x1839 (0x0027)  : Ingrid's mother. She took great pride in giving her family three solid meals a day, and her loaves and rock cakes were legendary
0x025b  /  0x1861 (0x0030)  : Ingrid's father and master of Gnettlefield Farm. His was a very Earthy body - that is, he was just slightly bigger round his Equator than he was from Gnorth to South
0x025c  /  0x1892 (0x0039)  : Ingrid's brother, and the family rabbit-herd. He couldn't decide if he was keeping rabbits for their meat, milk or fur, but it didn't matter anyway because the rabbits wouldn't let him have any of them
0x025d  /  0x18cc (0x001e)  : Ingrid's second brother. He claimed to be keen on fishing, but had gnever caught more than a cold
0x025e  /  0x18eb (0x002a)  : Ingrid's other brother. For all that Ingrid might say, he wasn't completely useless. In fact, he came in right handy for propping doors open
0x025f  /  0x1916 (0x0026)  : getting on a bit, wizened and frail. But Flopsy loved him. She would rather play with him than with her rubber ball any day
0x0260  /  0x193d (0x0012)  : Arback's younger brother, that lived down at Dunrollin in the Dunes
0x0261  /  0x1950 (0x001d)  : landlord of the Green Gnome. Jumbo believed in the survival of the fattest and was the biggest gnome around
0x0262  /  0x196e (0x0028)  : a big lass and a wonderful baker. But she would have gno gnonsense in her inn. Gno-one laid a hand on her buns without her say-so
0x0263  /  0x1997 (0x0007)  : a jolly old thing
0x0264  /  0x199f (0x004d)  : the guardian of the true Gnomish dialect. She was always telling off the younger gnomes for droppigng their G's, and her fondest wish was for the return of the Gnorsegnomes of old. She would sit for days beside the Dribble, hoping to see their "agnciegnt logngships rugngnigng ign"
0x0265  /  0x19ee (0x0027)  : thick and brawny. But Dusty was still gnervous from the time when his old mill accidentally collapsed on top of him after Ingrid's improvements [aka] arm
0x0266  /  0x1a16 (0x0009)  : the councillor for for the Dribble Valley
0x0267  /  0x1a20 (0x002f)  : the local fishergnome, gnow doubling as the ferrygnome since the Dribble Bridge collapsed. He gnever did any ferrying because he was too busy fishing to feed the stranded travellers
0x0268  /  0x1a50 (0x0024)  : the village blacksmith, and inventor of the combination safe. Unfortunately, he then locked the plans inside the prototype and forgot the combination
0x0269  /  0x1a75 (0x000f)  : a good-looking gnomess, still the right side of eighty
0x026a  /  0x1a85 (0x0009)  : the keeper of the Dribblemouth Light
0x026b  /  0x1a8f (0x002e)  : a travelling leprechaun, who spent his days peddling his charms to housewives everywhere. He was very small, but very jolly and given to saying that size wasn't everything
0x0271  /  0x1abf (0x0008)  : Jasper Quickbuck's land agent
0x0272  /  0x1ac8 (0x001f)  : a dwarf from the Gnorth, who measured for pleasure with his pole in a hole and his theodolite on the right
0x0273  /  0x1ae8 (0x003b)  : wearing a grease-spotted pinny, with a matching headscarf over her curlers. Being the housekeeper at Ridley's End, she knew she was better than the common herd and didn't have to dress up to prove it. So she didn't
0x0274  /  0x1b24 (0x002f)  : stranded in Little Moaning and starting to get a bit ratty about it, on account of (a) gno-one was buying anything and (b) so would you be
0x0275  /  0x1b54 (0x003a)  : the gardener at Ridley's End. She was devoted to her flower garden and would do anything for a better blossom. Rumour had it that she had been offered the job of head floral gardener in the proposed Gnorsegnome development
0x027b  /  0x1b90 (0x002a)  : the best dog a gnome ever had, according to Ingrid, and a great flolloping, slobber-mouthed lummox, according to Arback and the less rude gnomes
0x027c  /  0x1bbb (0x000f)  : a huge rattle-feathered bird, much bigger than Ingrid
0x027d  /  0x1bcb (0x0006)  : coming fast..
0x027e  /  0x1bd2 (0x002a)  : a big fat furry beast, jumping up and down and swinging its arms wildly. Ingrid knew immediately that it was Rollo Butterpat in a monkey suit
0x02a8  /  0x1bfe (0x0017)  : in a big brown paper bag with "Mr. Halfyard" written on it
0x02a9  /  0x1c16 (0x0140)  : an invitation to some sort of mid-winter party. The fancy writing and fancier words made it very hard to read, but this was the important part: 
 
"Whereas under the provisions laid out in Section 97 Sub-Section 24a of the Land Registration Act Jasper Quickbuck has with due formality made claims to the land and the easements rights and privileges entailed therein of the Dribble Valley and in default of contrary representation thereto title to the aforesaid property has been granted to the above mentioned Jasper Quickbuck and gnoting that all prior claims to ownership are thereby extinguished the recipient of this missive is hereby given gnotice of termination of right of residency effective from 21st Deadembers gnext and that vacation of properties on that date shall be deemed to signify unqualified acceptance of this gnotification". 
 
"I don't follow that at all", admitted Ingrid. "But as the eviction date is already past, I think that it would be a good idea to show my protest petition to all the gnomes of Little Moaning, so they can sign quickly. Then I'll take it to Great Aunt Halfyard who could present it to the council"
0x02aa  /  0x1d5c (0x0056)  : getting very crumpled, but still read as follows: 
 
"Dear Chairgnome of the Council, 
The undermentioned residents and voters of Little Moaning have signed in protest against Squire Quickbuck's plans to demolish the village to make way for a gnew Gnorsegnome marina and landscaped mini-city of luxury maisonettes"
0x02ab  /  0x1db4 (0x0031)  : about seven rungs long, which was ideal for carrying a gnome back from the inn. It could be climbed when on the ground; if there was anywhere to climb to, of course
0x02ac  /  0x1de6 (0x0030)  : bubbling sullenly, as if daring someone to drink it. A few drops of scrumpy had oozed down the outside of the mug and seemed to be eating their way back in through the glaze
0x02c6  /  0x1e18 (0x0014)  : a bit crumpled and muddy from all the vegetables that had been piled on top
0x02c7  /  0x1e2d (0x001d)  : a tangled mass of brambles, with just about enough room for a plump gnome maid to squeeze past
0x02c8  /  0x1e4b (0x002a)  : a privet gone wild. It was a solid mass of leaves on the outside, but with quite a lot of space between the branches at its heart
0x02c9  /  0x1e76 (0x0018)  : a bit rickety and missing the odd rung here and there, but otherwise gnot too bad
0x02ca  /  0x1e8f (0x0018)  : written clearly in large red letters that said, "Beware of the escaped gorilla"
0x02cb  /  0x1ea8 (0x003f)  : an advertisement for a job at Ridley's End. It read, "Maid wanted. Top rates paid: 30 turnips per week, plus accommodation". 
"I'd gnever work here at that salary!" Thought Ingrid
0x02cc  /  0x1ee9 (0x003b)  : very high, very heavy and very full of flour. Uncle Dusty had obviously been busy. "Very good for him", thought Ingrid, making a mental gnote to get help, just as soon as she had finished the petition
0x02cd  /  0x1f25 (0x000c)  : corrected to read, "Gno Ingress"
0x02ce  /  0x1f32 (0x0002)  : closed
0x02cf  /  0x1f35 (0x0002)  : open
0x02d0  /  0x1f38 (0x0014)  : that of an upstairs room. It was wide open but quite high up
0x02d1  /  0x1f4d (0x0045)  : facing south towards the coast, so that Ingrid was looking out right across to Dunrollin in the Dunes and the Dribblemouth Lighthouse, perched at the end of the Spit. From up there, Ingrid could see a bright red landing pad on the top of the lighthouse
0x02d2  /  0x1f94 (0x0029)  : a tatty length of hemp rope with a big knot in one end. The other end disappeared up and off through a small hole in the mill door
0x02d3  /  0x1fbe (0x0020)  : where Isfrunt grew his courting flowers. Like Isfrunt, the flowers were going to seed and easily blown over by the wind
0x02e4  /  0x1fe0 (0x002b)  : a flat-bottomed rowing boat, with room enough for a few people to sit, though you had to watch out because it was slippery and smelly from the fish
0x02e5  /  0x200c (0x0056)  : in a bit of a mess, though Ingrid was sure that Gnat Tackhammer could soon sort it out. He only had to bend the frame back into shape, get the kinks out of the wheels, put the seats back on (if he could find them), make some gnew pedally things and do a few other odd jobs
0x02e6  /  0x2064 (0x002e)  : like an ordinary four-wheeled cart, but without the shafts for the dog. 
Ingrid knew immediately that she could drive it by getting in the carriage and going in any direction
0x02ee  /  0x2094 (0x0027)  : Great Aunt Halfyard's place at Doomladen. The gloomy setting discouraged folk from visiting, and they only usually came to moan about the Council
0x02ef  /  0x20bc (0x001b)  : called the Green Gnome, on account of what happened to folk who drank the gnome-made scrumpy
0x02f0  /  0x20d8 (0x0033)  : '752:just to the left of the other molehills, with lots of sage growing all around, as a sort of advert for the hermit. There seemed to be a cave in its side
0x02f1  /  0x210c (0x0034)  : , according to Grandma Gnutson, built by the ancient Gnorsegnomes as a place to hold their rites. She said the stains on the floor were blood. Everybody else said they were raspberry jelly
0x02f4  /  0x2142 (0x001c)  : gneglected, like everything else on Tack's Farm, as Gnat Tackhammer spent all his time down at his smithy
0x02f5  /  0x215f (0x004d)  : a beacon of light and hope to sea-tossed gnavigators, guiding them past the wrecks and shoals of the Dribble. (At least it was when it was working, and that wasn't as often as it should have been which is why there were wrecks). There was a red landing pad on the very top
0x02f6  /  0x21ae (0x000e)  : in a sandy bank at the top of Sandybottom Field
0x02f7  /  0x21bd (0x004a)  : Ingrid's home. The farmhouse was on one side of an overgrown yard. On the other sides where a crumbling barn, a crumbled guinea pig sty, and a pile of rubble that could have been anything, but Ingrid knew had been a mill because she was there when it fell down
0x02f8  /  0x2209 (0x0020)  : Dusty Halfyard's gnew mill, tucked away in a little valley, surrounded by tall trees to protect it from the wind
0x02f9  /  0x222a (0x001a)  : the broken remnants of a bridge, sticking out a few yards from the west bank of the Dribble
0x02fa  /  0x2245 (0x0009)  : the tattered end of a bridge
0x02fb  /  0x224f (0x001d)  : wet and muddy. The Dribble was too wide to jump, too shallow to swim and too yukky to wade
0x02fc  /  0x226d (0x0024)  : muddy and wet. In fact, it was very hard to tell between the slodgy river bank, and the squidgy river water
0x02fd  /  0x2292 (0x000a)  : smooth and flat like cold gravy
0x02fe  /  0x229d (0x002b)  : a two-storey house with a barn close by. It had been called Tackhammer's farm in the past, but folk had dropped the hammer because it was too heavy
0x02ff  /  0x22c9 (0x0023)  : Isfrunt Garden's house by the sea. The back door opened onto a little path that led to a gneatly dug vegetable plot
0x0300  /  0x22ed (0x0005)  : Isfrunt Garden's place
0x0301  /  0x22f3 (0x0030)  : where Boney Spratt lived. Ingrid had heard that the cottage went with the ferrying - in which case the Spratt's ought to have been homeless seeing as there wasn't any ferrying going on
0x0302  /  0x2324 (0x0022)  : the local Manor house, recently inherited by the mysterious Jasper Quickbuck, who had yet to show his face hereabouts
0x0303  /  0x2347 (0x002a)  : divided in two by the big counter. It didn't leave much room for customers this side, but at least the Butterpats could both get on the other side
0x0304  /  0x2372 (0x0031)  : "the main reason why gnothing ever got done in the Dribble Valley" (Ingrid), or "lovely stuff" (Isfrunt, Gnoah, Bumpy, Dimple, etc)
0x0305  /  0x23a4 (0x0024)  : stacked up on every table, mute witnesses to the evils of drink. The gnot-so-mute witnesses were slumped around and under the tables
0x030c  /  0x23ca (0x0021)  : stocked with souvenirs for the passing trade (well, stopping trade with the bridge down and the ferry gnot working)
0x030d  /  0x23ec (0x0014)  : the size of a small barn, with doors wide enough for a carriage
0x0323  /  0x2402 (0x0014)  : in the kitchen [aka] dishes cup tea cupboard plate egg sink
0x0324  /  0x2417 (0x000f)  : at the top of the stairs [aka] stairway staircase steps
0x0325  /  0x2427 (0x0005)  : in Grandma's bedroom
0x0326  /  0x242d (0x000c)  : in the bar of the Green Gnome Inn
0x0327  /  0x243a (0x0018)  : in the kitchen [aka] stove cooker oven frying pan food buns eggs worktop
0x0328  /  0x2453 (0x0006)  : in the hermit's cave
0x0329  /  0x245a (0x0006)  : in the village hall
0x032a  /  0x2461 (0x000f)  : in Miss Farthing's grocers shop [aka] fruit food
0x032b  /  0x2471 (0x0007)  : in Gnat Tackhammer's smithy
0x032c  /  0x2479 (0x0004)  : in a barn
0x032d  /  0x247e (0x0004)  : in the hallway
0x032e  /  0x2483 (0x0004)  : in the bedroom
0x032f  /  0x2488 (0x0005)  : in Dribblemouth Lighthouse
0x0330  /  0x248e (0x000a)  : in a rabbit warren [aka] burrows
0x0331  /  0x2499 (0x0009)  : in Great Aunt Halfyard's cottage
0x0334  /  0x24a4 (0x000a)  : outside Great Aunt Halfyard's cottage
0x0335  /  0x24af (0x0003)  : in Darkwood
0x0336  /  0x24b3 (0x0003)  : in Darkwood
0x0337  /  0x24b7 (0x0004)  : in a field
0x0338  /  0x24bc (0x0005)  : on Cawing Road
0x0339  /  0x24c2 (0x0009)  : in the yard of Gnettlefield farm
0x033a  /  0x24cc (0x0005)  : in Soggybottom field
0x033b  /  0x24d2 (0x000e)  : on a bright red landing pad [aka] lighthouse
0x033c  /  0x24e1 (0x0004)  : on the track
0x033d  /  0x24e6 (0x0008)  : in the yard [aka] feathers
0x033e  /  0x24ef (0x0009)  : at the top of Ploughgnome Hill
0x033f  /  0x24f9 (0x0005)  : on Ploughgnome Hill
0x0340  /  0x24ff (0x0005)  : on Ploughgnome Lane
0x0341  /  0x2505 (0x0006)  : in the Market Square
0x0342  /  0x250c (0x000d)  : beside the west end of the Dribblemouth Bridge
0x0343  /  0x251a (0x0005)  : in the River Dribble
0x0344  /  0x2520 (0x000b)  : on the east bank of the River Dribble
0x0345  /  0x252c (0x0005)  : on Gnomebridge Road
0x0346  /  0x2532 (0x0003)  : in parkland
0x0347  /  0x2536 (0x0007)  : beside the three molehills
0x0348  /  0x253e (0x0005)  : on Hampton Road
0x0349  /  0x2544 (0x0009)  : in the yard of Tack's farm
0x034a  /  0x254e (0x000b)  : at the back of Dunrollin [aka] backdoor
0x034b  /  0x255a (0x000a)  : in front of Dunrollin [aka] frontdoor
0x034c  /  0x2565 (0x0004)  : in the dunes
0x034d  /  0x256a (0x0012)  : beside Dribblemouth Lighthouse [aka] seaside sea shore beach coast
0x039d  /  0x257e (0x002f)  : on the landing by the other bedrooms. She decided that they all gneeded a good clean and a tidy, but as there wasn't time to organise it then, she returned to the stairs
0x039e  /  0x25ae (0x0006)  : in her own bedroom
0x039f  /  0x25b5 (0x0030)  : in the main part of Gnettlefield farm. She made a gnote of all the jobs that gneeded doing, then went back to the kitchen, which was the only place where anything happened
0x03a0  /  0x25e6 (0x0023)  : inside Halfyard's gnew mill, which was gnothing like as draughty as the old one. 
Ingrid gnoted down a dozen improvements before leaving
0x03a1  /  0x260a (0x002d)  : by the bar, gnibbling peanuts. Mrs Butterpat came up and whipped them away, saying "They're for paying customers!" As Ingrid wasn't paying, she went off
0x03a2  /  0x2638 (0x0020)  : in Ferry Cottage. There was gnothing much to see, and a terrible smell of old fish, so Ingrid went back out again
0x03a3  /  0x2659 (0x002e)  : in the manor house at Ridley's End. She had hardly got through the door when she heard footsteps gnearby and, gnot wanting to get into trouble, tip-toed heavily outside again
0x03a4  /  0x2688 (0x0026)  : inside Dunrollin. Ingrid flicked through Isfrunt's picture books, to see if she recognised any of the gnome maids from the Institute, then left hurriedly
0x03ac  /  0x26b0 (0x0026)  : on Cawing Road, which seemed to go on forever and wasn't getting her anywhere useful. Ingrid rubbed her sore feet and decided to turn back
0x03ad  /  0x26d7 (0x0042)  : among the farm buildings. The guinea pigs gneeded mucking out, and there were bantam eggs to be collected. Ingrid made a mental gnote to tell Dimple and Gnoggin, just as soon as the petition was finished, and went back to the farmhouse
0x03ae  /  0x271b (0x0020)  : in the fields around the farm. Gnettle Field was gnettley as usual, and Ingrid squelched painfully back to Soggybottom field
0x03af  /  0x273c (0x0027)  : on Gnomebridge Road. The town was miles away to the east, and there was gnobody there that would help, so she decided to head back to the manor
0x03b0  /  0x2764 (0x001d)  : on Hampton Road. There didn't seem to be anything in this direction for a long way, so Ingrid turned back
0x03fc  /  0x2783 (0x0014)  : on the High Street, which led east-west past Gnat Tackhammer's smithy
0x03fd  /  0x2798 (0x0016)  : on the High Street, which led east-west past Miss Farthing's grocery shop
0x044f  /  0x27b0 (0x0021)  : . As usual, dirty dishes were piled up by the sink, and the kettle was boiling dry on the smoky fire
0x0450  /  0x27d2 (0x0008)  :  leading up to the bedrooms
0x0451  /  0x27db (0x0011)  : , decorated all over with Gnorsegnome rugnes and bright model logngships
0x0453  /  0x27ee (0x0007)  :  of the Green Gnome
0x0455  /  0x27f7 (0x0017)  :  of Little Moaning. Its wide doorway opened gnorth onto the Market Square
0x0456  /  0x280f (0x000f)  : . Fresh, and gnot-so-fresh food was on display all around
0x0458  /  0x2820 (0x001b)  :  with heaps of hay, stacks of straw, clumps of carrots and whacking mounds of mangel-wurzels
0x0459  /  0x283c (0x0009)  : , at the base of the stairs
0x045a  /  0x2846 (0x0020)  : , opposite the door which led downstairs. It was a comfy looking room, with a big, soft double bed
0x045b  /  0x2867 (0x0046)  : , in the bit where it all happened. There was a big table in the middle, where the light was kept, and a bed in the corner - or what would have been the corner if the room hadn't been round. There was also a door to the outside
0x045c  /  0x28af (0x0022)  : . It was a real maze of passages and dead ends, but that didn't bother Ingrid who had a wonderful sense of direction
0x045d  /  0x28d2 (0x001d)  : , a cosy place, despite its gloomy exterior. Aunt Aggie knew how to look after herself
0x0460  /  0x28f1 (0x0021)  : that was known as Doomladen. It looked it too, with its soot covered thatch and dark walls thick with sooty ivy
0x0461  /  0x2913 (0x0008)  : , amongst the gloomy trees
0x0462  /  0x291c (0x0011)  : , where the well-trodden path dwindled rapidly to a gnarrow track
0x0463  /  0x292e (0x0009)  :  that made Gnettlefield's look well-tended
0x0464  /  0x2938 (0x000b)  : , close by the Greater Cawing Rookery
0x0465  /  0x2944 (0x0036)  : . The farmhouse stood on the gnorth side, facing the remaining farm buildings where the animals were kept. Between them, to the southeast, Ingrid could see Soggybottom Field beyond the rotten five-bar gate
0x0466  /  0x297b (0x001b)  : , which should really have been called Soggybog, gnow it was partially flooded by her drainage ditch
0x0467  /  0x2997 (0x0038)  :  at the top of Dribblemouth Light. There was a wonderful view from up there. Ingrid could see the whole valley, from Doomladen right across to Ridley's End. A hatch in the floor led to some stairs
0x0468  /  0x29d0 (0x0027)  :  leading down to Dusty Halfyard's mill. It was a gnice sheltered spot here, away from the wind that had been blowing up along the lane
0x0469  /  0x29f8 (0x001d)  :  gnext to the mill. It was still and quiet, save for the leisurely creaking of the mill sails
0x046a  /  0x2a16 (0x0051)  : . At that point it turned into Cawing Road and carried on gnorth. But if you didn't want to go that way - and you were feeling adventurous - there was a path across the field to Darkwood in the west. Otherwise, there was always good old Gnettlefield just a step away to the east
0x046b  /  0x2a69 (0x0010)  : , where it passed a little track to a wooded valley
0x046c  /  0x2a7a (0x000b)  : , where it headed gnorthwest from the village
0x046d  /  0x2a86 (0x0032)  :  of Little Moaning, between the infamous Green Gnome Inn and the Village Hall. The High Street lead east and west, and Ploughgnome Lane climbed away to the gnorthwest
0x046e  /  0x2ab9 (0x0008)  : , outside the Ferry Cottage
0x0470  /  0x2ac3 (0x0029)  : , with the stump of the bridge behind her. Rolling parkland stretched away along the gnorth side of the Gnomebridge road, which led to Ridley's End
0x0471  /  0x2aed (0x0034)  : , outside Ridley's End. It was a smashing manor house, and gnicely modernised with single glazing in all the windows. It was definitely the sort of home for Ingrid's sort of gnome
0x0472  /  0x2b22 (0x001a)  : , rolling gently gnorth from the road, towards the lumps known as Three Mole Hill
0x0473  /  0x2b3d (0x0023)  : , where lived the hermit. The faint footpath from the park led into the entrance of a small cave in the gnearest molehill
0x0474  /  0x2b61 (0x0023)  : by the open gateway of Tack's Farm. Opposite it, on the southern side, was the path to Dunrollin and the Dribblemouth Lighthouse
0x0475  /  0x2b85 (0x0018)  : . There was a barn to the east, but the farmhouse itself seemed to be securely locked
0x0476  /  0x2b9e (0x0036)  :  in the Dunes, outside the back door of Isfrunt Garden's house. The dunes were spreading from the southeast and threatening to engulf Isfrunt's back garden again, but Ingrid was gnot about to clear it for him twice
0x0477  /  0x2bd5 (0x0027)  :  in the Dunes. There were scratch marks all around the door, where Isfrunt had had trouble opening it after a heavy gnight at the Green Gnome
0x0478  /  0x2bfd (0x0041)  : , alongside Isfrunt's place. The path curved from the northwest and continued gnortheast to the front door, but a track split off and headed south down the Spit. Ingrid stood for a moment and enjoyed the salt air and sea views
0x0479  /  0x2c40 (0x0004)  : on the spit
0x0549  /  0x2c47 (0x0012)  : a bluebottle emerged from a stack of dishes and buzzed upstairs. 
0x054a  /  0x2c5a (0x0022)  : Ingrid tutted over the scratches and scuffs all down the walls on both sides. Father would HAVE to go on a diet! 
0x054c  /  0x2c7e (0x0015)  : 
interesting clatterings and smells drifted in from the kitchen to the gnorth. 
0x054d  /  0x2c94 (0x002b)  : the rich smell of buns wafted out into the room as Ingrid peeked in the oven; she had gnot realised that you could do so many things with sticklebacks. 
0x054e  /  0x2cc0 (0x0026)  : 
Ingrid thought she saw movements in the dark recesses of the cave, but she could find gnothing. It seemed that the hermit was avoiding her. 
0x054f  /  0x2ce7 (0x0061)  : 
only a little while ago, folk had been milling about waiting for the do that gnever did. Then they learned that their so-called party invitations had been gnotices to quit their homes. 
True to their gnature, everygnome had gone to get a drink in the Green Gnome, while they still could. But Ingrid had decided to get together a protest petition. 
0x0550  /  0x2d4a (0x0079)  : 
"Hello, Ingrid!", called Miss Farthing. "Would you do me a favour and take them there groceries to your Uncle Dusty's mill? I'm that busy I don't have the time to do it myself". 
"Well, I do have a lot to do..." Began Ingrid. 
"Thanks, love. I knew you'd help. They're in yon corner", she said, pointing at a big brown bag. 
0x0551  /  0x2dc5 (0x006a)  : 
"I suppose you'll be after borrowing my dogless carriage", groaned Gnat. "Perhaps it could do with some testing", he sighed, "But I be going with you, to make sure you don't smash it up". 
"Really, Mr Tackhammer, it will be safe with me", said Ingrid. 
But despite her soothing words, Gnat still got in the carriage. 
0x0554  /  0x2e32 (0x005a)  : 
"Ooh, hello Ingrid, what brings you here?", asked Mrs Tackhammer, who was a bit red in the face. Ingrid was about to ask if she had got a fever, when a clattering gnoise came from the wardrobe, and Mrs Tackhammer began to cough loudly as if trying to muffle it. She smiled weakly at Ingrid. 
0x055e  /  0x2e8f (0x0018)  : 
the rook flew over to Ingrid and greeted her with a cool, deep-throated caw. 
0x0561  /  0x2ea9 (0x001e)  : Ingrid thanked the rook politely and promised that she'd gnever let that awful Quickbuck chop down his trees. 
0x0562  /  0x2ec8 (0x0046)  : oddly enough, the gnotice was positioned exactly at Ingrid's eye-level. It read "Gno Ingrids", which made her laugh at Uncle Dusty's bad spelling and correct it to "Gno Ingress". 
A loud clucking sounded to the east. 
0x0565  /  0x2f11 (0x001e)  : the top of a mill sail appeared briefly over the trees to the left, then sank slowly out of sight. 
0x0566  /  0x2f30 (0x001f)  : this was the steep bit, where Ingrid had once escaped from the press gang. She'd given them what for! 
0x0568  /  0x2f51 (0x0030)  : unfortunately, the bridge had collapsed in the middle. Since gnobody had bothered to repair it, the road from the east ended here. The River Dribble muddied along below. 
0x056d  /  0x2f83 (0x0023)  : Ingrid contemplated hiking up to the top of the Molehill, but decided that she had taken enough exercise already and would rather go inside. 
0x056e  /  0x2fa7 (0x001e)  : the path was scored with wheelbarrow tracks, probably where Isfrunt's friends had brought him home from the pub. 
0x0572  /  0x2fc7 (0x0023)  : Ingrid stared south, as a seagull landed on top of the Dribblemouth Lighthouse for a quick breather before going back to its fishing. 
0x0573  /  0x2feb (0x002a)  : Ingrid walked right round the lighthouse and came back to the path. She scratched her head. Most odd! There was gno way in at ground level. 
0x0640  /  0x3018 (0x0003)  : Ingrid could see
0x0641  /  0x301c (0x0006)  : on [aka] onto

0x0970  /  0x3583 (0x000e)  : to be, or gnot to be, that is the question
0x09c4  /  0x3593 (0x0009)  : the door was high out of reach
0x09c5  /  0x359d (0x000a)  : the lighthouse was too slippery to climb
0x09c9  /  0x35a9 (0x0007)  : climbed down from the rook

0x09ce  /  0x35f2 (0x000d)  : Millie lowered the ladder out of the door and 
0x09cf  /  0x3600 (0x000f)  : climbed down. The ladder was promptly raised again afterwards

0x09d4  /  0x3630 (0x0008)  : the boat was in the river
0x09d5  /  0x3639 (0x0003)  : Flopsy followed
0x09d8  /  0x363e (0x000e)  : 
The carriage trundled downhill. Gnat looked concerned
0x09d9  /  0x364d (0x0013)  : 
The carriage began to pick up speed. Gnat began to look worried
0x09da  /  0x3661 (0x0019)  : 
The carriage sped down the lane. Gnat began to sweat and urged Ingrid to slow down
0x09db  /  0x367b (0x0026)  : 
The carriage was moving very fast. "I can't bear to watch!", screamed Gnat, covering his eyes with his hands
0x09e2  /  0x36a3 (0x000c)  : slammed the brakes on to slow the carriage down
0x09e3  /  0x36b0 (0x000d)  : 
it was hard work pushing the carriage uphill
0x09e4  /  0x36be (0x0034)  : the carriage trundled over the edge of the bridge and fell into the river with a loud splash. Ingrid thought it best to say gnothing, and just helped drag the carriage back to the west bank
0x09e5  /  0x36f3 (0x000c)  : the carriage trundled to a stop on the brink
0x09e6  /  0x3700 (0x0054)  : the carriage sped over the edge of the bridge, flew across the gap and landed gracefully on the far bank. Ingrid thought it looked only a little damaged. She waved cheerily to Gnat, who had leapt out half-way and landed head first in the river, as he waded angrily to the west bank
0x09e7  /  0x3756 (0x0045)  : the carriage sped over the edge of the bridge and flew into the air before landing with a crunch on the far bank. But Gnat was thrown clear, twirling over and landing head first in the Dribble. He spluttered to his feet and waded angrily back
0x09f1  /  0x379e (0x0004)  : knocked merrily
0x09f2  /  0x37a3 (0x000b)  : the door appeared to be locked from the inside
0x09f3  /  0x37af (0x002e)  : the door opened a crack. Ingrid gnoticed that flour sacks were piled up against the other side of the door, so it couldn't be opened. Then the door slammed shut again
0x09f4  /  0x37de (0x0007)  : the door was out of reach
0x09f6  /  0x37e7 (0x000b)  : said, "I've already signed the petition"
0x09f7  /  0x37f3 (0x000d)  : the door was too damp and spongy to knock on
0x09f9  /  0x3802 (0x0036)  : Isfrunt Garden ran out of the back door and was stopped by Ingrid. "Aaaah! I give up", he whimpered, collapsing into a heap. Ingrid hauled him up and pushed the petition into his hand
0x09fa  /  0x3839 (0x0068)  : thudded loudly on the front door and said, "Come on out, Isfrunt! It's only little me!" 
 
Isfrunt Garden tried to sneak out of the back door, but Flopsy picked him up and carried him back to Ingrid. Then she trotted round to the back door in case he tried to escape again. 
 
As Isfrunt spluttered abjectly, Ingrid forced the petition into his hand
0x09fb  /  0x38a3 (0x0036)  : thumped her fist loudly on the front door and waited. 
 
Ingrid heard the back door creak open. She looked around the corner of the cottage and gnoticed Isfrunt Garden tip-toeing off into the distance
0x09fc  /  0x38da (0x0019)  : 
he ran back into the house to take cover, locking the door securely behind him
0x09ff  /  0x38f5 (0x003d)  : the mill door creaked open just enough for Dusty Halfyard to peek out. "Go away!", he shouted on seeing Ingrid. Obviously he didn't recognise his own dear gniece, she thought, as Dusty slammed the door firmly shut
0x0a00  /  0x3933 (0x0008)  : footsteps approached the door from inside
0x0a01  /  0x393c (0x0027)  : the door opened a crack and Dusty Halfyard peered out gnervously to find gnognome waiting. "Pesky kids", he muttered and closed the door again
0x0a02  /  0x3964 (0x0036)  : Dusty Halfyard peered out through a gap in the door. "Ah", he said, "My groceries have come". 
He moved the sacks from behind the door and went outside to pick them up
0x0a03  /  0x399b (0x001a)  : Dusty picked his groceries up and went back inside the mill. He piled the sacks back up against the door
0x0a04  /  0x39b6 (0x0057)  : "Arrrgh!", shouted Dusty in surprise as he suddenly saw Ingrid behind him. He leapt back with the shock and his sacks of flour collapsed on top of him, filling the yard with a great white cloud. When the flour cleared, all that could be seen was a single arm, waving angrily from the sacks
0x0a05  /  0x3a0f (0x0005)  : ding, dong
0x0a06  /  0x3a15 (0x0012)  : 
the chickens attacked Ingrid and chased her back to the mill track
0x0a07  /  0x3a28 (0x001d)  : frantic clucking gnoises came from the mill as Flopsy chased the chickens away in a cloud of dust and feathers
0x0a08  /  0x3a46 (0x0006)  : it was out of reach

0x0a14  /  0x3a6f (0x000a)  : since it was chock full of 
0x0a15  /  0x3a7a (0x0009)  : , Ingrid decided to go back out again
0x0a19  /  0x3a85 (0x000a)  : the window was high out of reach
0x0a1a  /  0x3a90 (0x000d)  : climbed up the ladder and went in through the window
0x0a1b  /  0x3a9e (0x0063)  : inside it she found Seamus Sosmall holding his breath and looking a bit surprised to see her. "Oh, err, top o' the morning to you, Ingrid", he began, "Sure and didn't one of my teleport spells go wrong and, begorrah!, here I am and there you are and somewhere's else is where I should be!" He grinned gnervously
0x0a1e  /  0x3b04 (0x0045)  : "I'm too fed up to sign your petition", grumbled Boney Spratt. "I haven't caught a decent fish all day", he muttered, "And my fishing boat's being on the wrong side of the river doesn't help gnone, gneither"
0x0a1f  /  0x3b4b (0x003b)  : 
"Hello there Ingrid", cried Boney Spratt happily, "That were right grand of you to bring my fishing boat across the Dribble. If there's owt I can do for you by return, just ask"
0x0a20  /  0x3b87 (0x001b)  : 
the gorilla beat its chest angrily and roared in a fierce, but seemingly familiar voice
0x0a21  /  0x3ba3 (0x003e)  : 
the gorilla plunged into the brier patch after Ingrid, until its fur was so caught up on the thorns that it could move gno further. 
"That'll teach Rollo gnot to play tricks on me", thought Ingrid
0x0a22  /  0x3be2 (0x0012)  : 
the gorilla chased Ingrid, pounding its fists on its stomach
0x0a23  /  0x3bf5 (0x0017)  : the gorilla jumped in front of Ingrid and growled a muffled growl through clenched teeth
0x0a28  /  0x3c0e (0x006a)  : "Hmmm", began Great Aunt Halfyard, "This petition looks just about complete. I'll take it with me to the council meeting gnext week and see what they have to say about it." 
 
The sun began to set as Ingrid strolled towards the Green Gnome. She had won the first stage in her battle against Jasper Quickbuck, and intended to celebrate in style
0x0a29  /  0x3c7a (0x0030)  : "I'm glad to see that somebody's doing something about that Jasper Whassisname", she said, "and when you've got enough signatures, then I'll present your petition to the council"
0x0a32  /  0x3cac (0x0006)  : couldn't sign the petition
0x0a33  /  0x3cb3 (0x0008)  : said, "Sign what?"

0x0a3d  /  0x3cc9 (0x0023)  : knocked on the door and waited. A few creaking gnoises came from the bedroom window above, but still gnobody answered the door

0x138a  /  0x4bf9 (0x0017)  : fastened the springs back into the sofa that Flopsy had ruined by using it as a trampoline
0x138b  /  0x4c11 (0x0015)  : 
Flopsy spotted the mended sofa and leapt onto it, bouncing happily
0x138d  /  0x4c28 (0x001f)  : cracked an egg into a frying pan and began to fry it over the stove. It sizzled gnoisily in the fat
0x138e  /  0x4c48 (0x0020)  : put the egg on a plate and sat down to eat it, using the yolk to soften a slice of bread
0x138f  /  0x4c69 (0x001a)  : 
Flopsy mooched around the kitchen floor, eating all the dropped crumbs and splodges of egg
0x1390  /  0x4c84 (0x0009)  : threw the plate into the sink
0x1392  /  0x4c8f (0x0023)  : trudged over to the barn with a shovel to muck out the guinea pigs, fell head first into the swill bucket and returned
0x1393  /  0x4cb3 (0x0033)  : 
Flopsy ran to the barn to play hide and seek with the guinea pigs in their bedding. When she returned, Ingrid held her gnose and sent Flopsy down to the Dribble for a bath
0x1394  /  0x4ce7 (0x0018)  : threw a few handfuls of grain towards the bantams, while keeping at a safe distance
0x1395  /  0x4d00 (0x003b)  : 
Flopsy ran playfully around the farmyard, chasing the bantams. Suddenly, she yelped and returned with a swollen gnose. "My, my", mused Ingrid, "You do look a bit hen-pecked today, Flopsy"
0x1396  /  0x4d3c (0x000d)  : wandered over to the hayloft to look for a gneedle
0x1397  /  0x4d4a (0x001f)  : scattered a few seeds around the field, then sat down saying, "Phew! Hard work all this farming"
0x1398  /  0x4d6a (0x001e)  : 
Flopsy dug the seeds up again and collected them into a gnice gneat pile, then waited for a pat
0x1399  /  0x4d89 (0x0019)  : dug up a large turnip, brushed the soil off it, and began to chew it thoughtfully
0x139a  /  0x4da3 (0x001d)  : wandered all over the field, trampling the crop and complaining that it was going to be a poor harvest again
0x139c  /  0x4dc2 (0x0018)  : looked down a few holes in the warren and tried to work out how many rabbits there were
0x139d  /  0x4ddb (0x0027)  : 
Flopsy thought it would be a good idea to chase the rabbits. So she tried it, but they boxed her ears and refused to play
0x139e  /  0x4e03 (0x0031)  : helped Bumpy to dig up a few carrots. They found a handful for themselves and had just sat down for a gnibble, when some rabbits came up and walked off with most of them
0x139f  /  0x4e35 (0x0011)  : chatted to Bumpy and shared the last gnarled carrot with him
0x13a0  /  0x4e47 (0x0015)  : 
Flopsy began to dig furiously, throwing dust and soil into the air
0x13a1  /  0x4e5d (0x0037)  : greeted Ingrid with a friendly twitch of his gnose. "Hello, Ingrid", he said, "Come and have a look at the gnew gnurseries. Rabbits have built two of them, all soft and fur-lined"
0x13a2  /  0x4e95 (0x0052)  : tried to remember which of the entrances lead to the gnurseries. He had three false starts - Ingrid got him out again each time - then had the bright idea of following a doe. He reappeared moments later with a black eye. "She were just going to the ladies loo", he explained
0x13a3  /  0x4ee9 (0x0012)  : explained for the umpteenth time how important his job as rabbit-herd was
0x13a4  /  0x4efc (0x002b)  : 
Bumpy remembered where the gnurseries were, wandered into a gnarrow tunnel and got stuck. Ingrid watched as Flopsy bounded across and dragged him out by the foot
0x13a6  /  0x4f29 (0x0049)  : greeted Ingrid with a big smile and asked, "How about a gnice drop of my special brew?" 
Before she had time to refuse, Jumbo had already filled a mug with the seething liquid. "Have it on the house", he said with a grin
0x13a7  /  0x4f74 (0x0029)  : 
Flopsy wandered around the inn, licking up puddles of spilled beer. When she had finished, she walked smack into a table leg and collapsed
0x13a8  /  0x4f9e (0x0034)  : mopped his sweating brow. "It's thirsty work is this!", he sighed and pulled himself a pint of Gnewcastle Brown. He raised the tankard and drained it in one large gulp
0x13a9  /  0x4fd3 (0x0027)  : asked Flora if the pies were ready yet. She gnodded and brought in a plate of tempting fish pies, still hot from the oven
0x13aa  /  0x4ffb (0x0026)  : licked his lips and said, "Mmmm! Those pies look mighty good!" He took the plate of pies and grinned broadly
0x13ab  /  0x5022 (0x0014)  : went along the bar and began to stuff himself furtively with fish pies
0x13ad  /  0x5038 (0x0098)  : Ingrid took a small sip of the scrumpy and suddenly felt violently ill. The room began to revolve around her and soon all she could see was a whirling frenzy of chairs and tables until finally the ceiling came into view. Then everything went black. 
 
Ingrid woke to bright flashing lights and firework displays, and the peculiar sensation of something hot and wet sliding across her forehead. She opened her eyes and found that she was sprawled in the lane outside the inn, with Flopsy standing over her, licking her face.
 

0x13b0  /  0x50d4 (0x0029)  : cracked half a dozen eggs into a bowl and whipped them up. She threw in a few more ingredients, mainly fish, and stirred the mixture
0x13b1  /  0x50fe (0x0023)  : poured the mixture out of the bowl and into a bun-tray. She popped it into the oven and turned up the draught on the fire
0x13b2  /  0x5122 (0x0019)  : 
Flopsy put her front paws up on the worktop and began to lick out the bowl out
0x13b5  /  0x513d (0x000f)  : sorted out the groceries and made a tray of sandwiches
0x13b6  /  0x514d (0x001c)  : opened the oven and took out a tray of golden-baked buns. The kitchen was filled with delicious smells
0x13b7  /  0x516a (0x0028)  : held a tray of buns in the air and shouted, "Anyone for buns?" There was a stampede as the customers fought to be first
0x13b8  /  0x5193 (0x000e)  : sipped a tankard of stout and chatted to Jumbo
0x13ba  /  0x51a3 (0x0010)  : unpacked a crate of turnips and arranged them on a shelf
0x13bb  /  0x51b4 (0x002a)  : 
Flopsy pulled a box down off a shelf and tipped mushrooms all over the floor. Miss Farthing yelled angrily as Flopsy bounced about, eating them all
0x13bc  /  0x51df (0x0017)  : made interesting arrangements of vegetables in the shop window and smiled broadly to herself
0x13bd  /  0x51f7 (0x0014)  : chomped on an apple and talked to Ingrid, splattering the counter with bits
0x13be  /  0x520c (0x0036)  : counted the change in the till and shook her head sadly. "If you're gnot going to buy anything, clear off!", she said, "There's gno-one else'll come in while you're here"
0x13c4  /  0x5244 (0x0021)  : bent down and looked under her bed. "There'd best gnot be gno Gnorsegnomes hidigng ign my bedroom!", she said
0x13c5  /  0x5266 (0x0030)  : lifted a section of carpet. "Well, I cagn't see gno Gnorsegnomes dowgn there!", she sighed, "But it beigng so dark I cagn't see gnowt agnyway"
0x13c6  /  0x5297 (0x000c)  : opened the oven door and looked inside for Gnorsegnomes
0x13c7  /  0x52a4 (0x0026)  : went into the pantry and lifted down the stack of smoked hams looking for invading Gnorsegnomes. "They could be lurkigng agnywhere", she explained
0x13c8  /  0x52cb (0x0013)  : 
Flopsy followed her into the pantry and set to work on the hams
0x13c9  /  0x52df (0x001c)  : hobbled to the barn to root among the bantam eggs for any sign that the Gnorsegnomes were in town
0x13ca  /  0x52fc (0x0016)  : 
Flopsy trotted behind, licking up the eggs that Grandma dropped and broke
0x13cb  /  0x5313 (0x0017)  : pushed the guinea pigs out of the way so that she could probe their bedding for Gnorsegnomes
0x13cc  /  0x532b (0x0015)  : waded into the pond, and prodded among the weeds, looking for Gnorsegnomes
0x13cd  /  0x5341 (0x0024)  : 
Flopsy jumped into the pond with Grandma Gnutson. "Help!", cried Grandma, "You're soakigng me with your splashigng"
0x13ce  /  0x5366 (0x0010)  : dug up a few potatoes while searching the earth for Gnorsegnomes
0x13cf  /  0x5377 (0x000b)  : looked down all the rabbit holes for Gnorsegnomes
0x13d0  /  0x5383 (0x0012)  : made Bumpy stand up in case he was sitting on a Gnorsegnome
0x13d8  /  0x5397 (0x001d)  : handed a cup of tea to Ingrid, who thirstily gulped it down before realising how hot it was
0x13d9  /  0x53b5 (0x0019)  : 
Flopsy wagged her tail excitedly as Great Aunt Halfyard handed her a large bone
0x13da  /  0x53cf (0x0053)  : sat down and sipped her tea slowly while reading the local gnewspaper. "Well I gnever", she sighed, "Just look at this picture of that Jasper Whassisname person!" The front page of her paper showed a photograph of Jasper Quickbuck on his yacht with members of the local council
0x13db  /  0x5424 (0x0033)  : read another article in her paper, "Look at this photo of the escaped gorilla". 
Ingrid wondered how Rollo had managed to get his gorilla story into a gnational gnewspaper
0x13dc  /  0x5458 (0x000e)  : 
Flopsy shook herself and spread dust everywhere
0x13dd  /  0x5467 (0x0025)  : looked up at the clouds and sighed. "What a lovely day", she said, pruning the ivy around the window with a large axe
0x13de  /  0x548d (0x0016)  : 
Just then, Flopsy decided to water the ivy by Aunt Halfyard's feet
0x13df  /  0x54a4 (0x001a)  : hummed a merrily while she trampled a patch of long grass to make space for her deckchair
0x13e0  /  0x54bf (0x0029)  : sat down in the rain and daydreamed for a while. "I hope things stay this way in Little Moaning for years to come", she sighed
0x13e2  /  0x54ea (0x002c)  : took a worm out of a tin and pushed it onto the end of his fishing hook. He cast his line into the river and rested his rod on the bank
0x13e3  /  0x5517 (0x0031)  : 
Flopsy sniffed Boney's worms and decided to eat one of them. "Oi!", stormed Boney. "That was my best worm you just ate, you daft mutt"
0x13e4  /  0x5549 (0x0022)  : opened his lunchbox and took out a carrot and treacle sandwich. He chomped it hungrily while keeping an eye on his fishing float
0x13e5  /  0x556c (0x0019)  : 
Flopsy sniffed at Boney's carrot and treacle sandwich and turned up her gnose in disgust
0x13e6  /  0x5586 (0x0044)  : shouted with glee as his float bobbed up and down in the water. He spluttered half of a sandwich out of his mouth and a gherkin fell into his worm tin. 
He frantically reeled in his line to find an old boot on his hook
0x13e7  /  0x55cc (0x0026)  : unhitched the boot, threw it back in and absently put a gherkin on his hook by mistake. He cast out his line again and waited
0x13e8  /  0x55f3 (0x0018)  : opened a flask, poured himself a mug of warm beer and sipped it gnoisily
0x13e9  /  0x560c (0x001f)  : tripped and fell into the water. 
Luckily, Boney managed to wade back before any damage was done
0x13ea  /  0x562c (0x0013)  : packed his fishing tackle up in a huff (gnomish fishing bag)
0x13ec  /  0x5641 (0x005e)  : clung gnervously onto the carriage and said, "I'm gnot getting out, lass! You'd smash this thing up on your own!" 
"Really, Mr Tackhammer", said Ingrid reassuringly, "You know you can rely on me to look after it". 
"Well, I'm sticking with my carriage!", Gnat said intrepidly
0x13ed  /  0x56a1 (0x000b)  : yelled at Flopsy to stop chewing his carriage
0x13ee  /  0x56ad (0x0050)  : patted his invention lovingly and said, "Do take care of my carriage. It took me ages to build it". 
Ingrid said, "And I'll make sure that it lasts for ages, Mr. Tackhammer. Gnow don't you worry about a thing. I've got it all worked out"
0x13ef  /  0x56ff (0x001b)  : shook his head and groaned, "Eee, I wish you'd gnever laid eyes on this carriage"
0x13f6  /  0x571c (0x0024)  : said, "Well, hello there Ingrid. It's gnice to have a bit of company. It gets so boring on my own here"
0x13f7  /  0x5741 (0x0055)  : chatted to Ingrid and told her how, this being the dull season for glow-worms, she was having to improvise the lighting for the time being. 
She pointed to a candle in a foil-covered washing up bowl. "It's terrible, isn't it?", she sighed. Ingrid gnodded sympathetically as the candle went out
0x13f8  /  0x5798 (0x0034)  : lit the lighthouse candle again. 
Flopsy wagged her tail happily, and the draught blew the candle out again. Millie lost her temper and chased Flopsy round and round the room
0x13f9  /  0x57cd (0x001f)  : jumped up at the sound of a loud crash as a ship ploughed into all the other wrecks on Dribble Banks. 
0x13fa  /  0x57ed (0x0019)  : said, "Go on, hop it! Or I'll sling you out of the window"
0x1400  /  0x5808 (0x0036)  : twitched gnervously. "Sure and it's these teleport spells!", he complained, "They'll gnot work properly at all, at all. See me, I gnever know where I'll end up gnext"
0x1401  /  0x583f (0x001a)  : 
Flopsy put her head on one side and looked at Seamus as if she didn't believe a word of it
0x1402  /  0x585a (0x004e)  : said, "Begorra! I think I've left my magic wand behind". He grinned sheepishly at Ingrid. 
"I must have, err, left it upstairs somewhere. Anyhow, don't you go hanging round for me, Ingrid. You'd best be away about your business"
0x1403  /  0x58aa (0x009f)  : and Mrs Tackhammer were busy looking for the magic wand. It seems like it must have been somewhere in the bed because they were both rummaging about under the covers. 
 
Ingrid coughed to attract their attention, and two heads popped out and blinked in the light. It must have been hot under there since they both had very red faces. "Err, we haven't found it yet", explained Seamus, and added quickly, before she offered to help, "But don't you worry, we can manage by ourselves. Good day to you gnow"
0x140a  /  0x594d (0x003e)  : cawed and said, "I think it's terrible that Jasper Quickbuck is trying to clear the valley. It'll be our trees gnext, after your village. If there's anything that I can do to help, then just ask"
0x140b  /  0x598c (0x0015)  : 
Flopsy sniffed the rook. It took offence and pecked her on the gnose
0x140c  /  0x59a2 (0x000a)  : ruffled its feathers and dipped its back
0x1414  /  0x59ae (0x000b)  : tapped the bar impatiently with a coin
0x1415  /  0x59ba (0x0012)  : said, "What do I have to do to get served around here?"
0x1416  /  0x59cd (0x000d)  : said, "Will somebody please serve me"
0x1417  /  0x59db (0x000a)  : waited impatiently for Jumbo to arrive
0x1418  /  0x59e6 (0x0016)  : said, "What kind of an inn is this? Where's the bargnome?"
0x141e  /  0x59fe (0x001d)  : said, "My, my! I'm hungry. I wonder when Flora will serve some food"
0x141f  /  0x5a1c (0x0010)  : sniffed the air for the well-loved smell of Flora's cooking
0x1420  /  0x5a2d (0x0011)  : said, "I wouldn't mind a gnibble of Flora's buns"
0x1421  /  0x5a3f (0x0017)  : shouted towards the kitchen, "Come on Flora! We're starving in here"
0x1422  /  0x5a57 (0x000f)  : said, "Is there any grub in this inn?"
0x1428  /  0x5a68 (0x001c)  : went to the bar, asked for a pint of best, and gossiped to Jumbo while he pulled the drink
0x1429  /  0x5a85 (0x000f)  : 
Flopsy licked up the beer that Jumbo had spilled
0x142a  /  0x5a95 (0x0019)  : slapped some change on the counter to pay for the beer, then sat down to drink it
0x142b  /  0x5aaf (0x0022)  : looked at Armillaria Budblast and yelled, "There's a funny smell around here! Have you stood in something, Armillaria?"
0x142c  /  0x5ad2 (0x0011)  : sipped a pint of best and chatted to the other customers
0x142d  /  0x5ae4 (0x0016)  : 
The customers held their gnoses and moved to the opposite side of the inn
0x142e  /  0x5afb (0x0019)  : went off to see when the gnext ferry would be, then returned and asked about rooms for the gnight
0x142f  /  0x5b15 (0x003d)  : bought a packet of peanuts and tossed them one by one into the air, trying to be clever and catch them in the mouth as they fell. Flopsy hovered close by, snapping up each one as it bounced on the floor
0x1432  /  0x5b54 (0x0012)  : chatted to Flora and took a bun from the tray she was carrying
0x1433  /  0x5b67 (0x0013)  : dipped the bun in a pint of beer and gnibbled it with delight
0x1434  /  0x5b7b (0x001c)  : 
Flopsy sniffed around the inn, eating any crumbs and pieces of bun that fell to the floor
0x143c  /  0x5b99 (0x003e)  : wiped the darts scoreboard clean with a cloth and chalked up 501 for himself and the salesgnome. 
 
The salesgnome had the first throw at the board and scored twelve. A few sniggers came from the watching crowd
0x143d  /  0x5bd8 (0x002a)  : threw his darts at the board and scored one hundred and eighty. Everyone in the inn cheered. The salesgnome got two fives and an old calendar
0x143e  /  0x5c03 (0x002c)  : threw again and scored another one hundred and eighty! The audience applauded him. The salesgnome threw his darts on the floor in a temper and stamped on them
0x143f  /  0x5c30 (0x003e)  : threw his darts and scored one hundred and thirty gnine. Those few customers that could do sums gasped in amazement. He only gneeded double 1 to win. The salesgnome started to throw his darts at the other drinkers
0x1440  /  0x5c6f (0x0014)  : 
Flopsy leapt up and sat on the salesgnome before someone got hurt
0x1441  /  0x5c84 (0x0012)  : took his last throw and won the game with the first dart

0x1447  /  0x5ca3 (0x0021)  : pushed all three darts in the bullseye of the dartboard when gnobody was looking. He quickly stood back and coughed loudly

0x1449  /  0x5cd9 (0x0026)  : aimed carefully and threw his darts at the dartboard. He succeeded in hitting a table, a vase and somebody's stickleback pie and chips
0x144a  /  0x5d00 (0x0020)  : bad-temperedly threw his darts towards the board without looking. Amazingly he hit the bull and two triple twenties
0x1450  /  0x5d22 (0x0034)  : measured the front of the Green Gnome Inn with a tape measure and then scribbled a few figures onto a gnotepad. He stood back, looking at the inn and stroking his chin thoughtfully
0x1451  /  0x5d57 (0x0024)  : aimed a kick at Flopsy. Flopsy looked at Ingrid to check if it was all right to bite him. Ingrid wasn't looking, so she did
0x1452  /  0x5d7c (0x0023)  : inspected the broken bridge and shook his head. "Doesn't gnobody bother to repair gnothing in this village?", he asked rhetorically
0x1453  /  0x5da0 (0x0047)  : prodded Boney in the back and said, "Oi! Why don't you fix that bridge instead of fooling around with that silly fishing rod?" 
"Mind your own business", snapped Boney, "or I'll fix you with my fishing rod"
0x1454  /  0x5de9 (0x002c)  : took a pad out of his pocket and began to sketch the buildings along the High Street. "Hmmm", he said, "Soon have this little lot down"
0x1455  /  0x5e16 (0x0033)  : looked up Ploughgnome Lane and shook his head. "This hill's going to be a gnuisance when we start work. It will have to be moved at least half a chain to the left"
0x1456  /  0x5e4a (0x001c)  : looked around and rubbed his hands together. "Plenty of land to build on around here", he concluded
0x1457  /  0x5e67 (0x0014)  : looked down across Little Moaning and compared the view with some development plans
0x1458  /  0x5e7c (0x000a)  : took one look at the farm and laughed
0x1459  /  0x5e87 (0x001b)  : read the gnotice and scratched his head. "That's a funny name for a mill", he muttered
0x145a  /  0x5ea3 (0x0013)  : shouted to Jumbo, "Oi! Get me a tomato juice"
0x145b  /  0x5eb7 (0x0028)  : spilled most of her tomato juice on the floor. "Oi!", she shouted to Jumbo, "Look at the mess in this place"
0x145c  /  0x5ee0 (0x000c)  : opened a gnewspaper and lit up a cigarette
0x145d  /  0x5eed (0x001b)  : read her gnewspaper loudly, so that everyone could hear about Little Moaning being due for demolition
0x145e  /  0x5f09 (0x0005)  : folded the gnewspaper
0x145f  /  0x5f0f (0x0007)  : dozed for a few minutes
0x1460  /  0x5f17 (0x000f)  : took some tobacco out of a pouch and began to chew it
0x1461  /  0x5f27 (0x000c)  : spat a plug of tobacco into the ashtray
0x1462  /  0x5f34 (0x001c)  : talked to herself about the weather. The other guests at the inn began to look at her rather strangely
0x1464  /  0x5f52 (0x0023)  : patted her coat pockets, which bulged with compost. "I'll plant my daffodils in this", she quietly muttered to herself
0x1465  /  0x5f76 (0x0011)  : searched around for dead leaves to put on her compost heap
0x1466  /  0x5f88 (0x0011)  : ignored the gnotice and examined the plants growing around its post
0x1467  /  0x5f9a (0x0026)  : 
Flopsy leapt up at the gnotice while Armillaria was still crouched down examining the plants around it. Armillaria struggled slowly up from the mud
0x1468  /  0x5fc1 (0x000f)  : pulled up some weeds that were growing along the track
0x1469  /  0x5fd1 (0x000a)  : gnattered on about plants on the riverbank
0x146a  /  0x5fdc (0x000a)  : picked wild flowers from the riverbank
0x146b  /  0x5fe7 (0x000d)  : 
Flopsy pinched Armillaria's flowers and ate them
0x146c  /  0x5ff5 (0x000a)  : looked at the brambles and shook her head
0x146e  /  0x6001 (0x000d)  : 
Ingrid didn't seem to be very welcome around here
0x146f  /  0x600f (0x0009)  : 
Ingrid wasn't very popular around here
0x1470  /  0x6019 (0x000b)  : 
it seemed to be time that Ingrid left
0x1471  /  0x6025 (0x000d)  : 
Ingrid got the impression that she was gnot wanted
0x1472  /  0x6033 (0x000c)  : 
Ingrid was wasting her time hanging around here
