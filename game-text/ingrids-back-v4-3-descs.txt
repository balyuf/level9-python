0x0259  /  0x1384 (0x002e)  : dressed in black with an off-white pinny and a little lace cap. Ingrid's mother thought she looked quite sweet - from the back, and preferably disappearing into the distance
0x025a  /  0x13b3 (0x002d)  : Ingrid's cousin, who had been a maid at Ridley's End since the old squire's times. And until they found an answer to the servant problem, she would stay there
0x025b  /  0x13e1 (0x0003)  : Ingrid's father
0x025c  /  0x13e5 (0x000f)  : a leprechaun of many charms, and a few spells
0x0260  /  0x13f6 (0x0024)  : a hairy gnome from Down-Under. As a singer, he was gnot a bad artist, and as an artist he was gnot a bad singer
0x0261  /  0x141b (0x0024)  : a stolid, stately man who strove always to remain calm despite the minor irritations of life, such as the maids
0x0262  /  0x1440 (0x003c)  : , so she claimed, a gnomess of taste and breeding. She could, gnormally, taste whether or gnot something was burned and she could breed bantams. All in all, she reckoned, Ridley's End was lucky to have her
0x0263  /  0x147d (0x0022)  : the housekeeper, and living proof of how difficult it is to get good servants gnowadays. I expect you've gnoticed that as well
0x0264  /  0x14a0 (0x0009)  : the gnew Lord of the Manor
0x0294  /  0x14ab (0x0021)  : a tweed hunting jacket, according to Daisy, though Ingrid didn't know there were any tweed to hunt in the Dribble Valley
0x02a8  /  0x14ce (0x0031)  : evidence against Jasper; there were two separate bank accounts. Ingrid guessed that there was some sort of tax fiddle going on, since one of them showed huge sums of cash
0x02a9  /  0x1500 (0x0036)  : marked with traces of a letter. Ingrid held it up to a mirror and read some evidence, ".. Tip about that take-over bid. I got in the day before and cleaned up gnicely.."

0x02ab  /  0x1541 (0x006d)  : Jasper's Faxofile. It contained evidence against Jasper; a vast collection of telephone gnumbers, including:

0x02ac  /  0x15b0 (0x0041)  : evidence against Jasper; a letter from the Department of Trade and Industry, saying that they had had some complaints about his gilt-trading firm and would be sending an inspector round in four or five years, but until then Jasper could carry on
0x02ad  /  0x15f3 (0x000e)  : evidence that the "robbery" was an insurance swindle
0x02ae  /  0x1602 (0x0013)  : a brilliant forgery of the Gnoma Lisa; more evidence against Jasper
0x02af  /  0x1616 (0x003d)  : a photograph of the Local Council Committee, enjoying themselves with scantily-clad gnomemaids aboard Jasper's yacht. "Aha", thought Ingrid, "gnow I have evidence of how he got his rotten planning permission for the Dribble Valley"
0x02b0  /  0x1654 (0x0017)  : a tape for the answering machine, ideal for recording evidence of Jasper's devious dealings
0x02b1  /  0x166c (0x0017)  : a small wooden drawer, a bit small for its position in the centre of the desk
0x02b2  /  0x1684 (0x002e)  : for owners of the telephone answering machine. Ingrid read, "With a tape in the machine, press RECORD when the telephone rings. To listen, press YALP"
0x02b4  /  0x16b4 (0x0008)  : a big fat leather one
0x02b5  /  0x16bd (0x0007)  : a fancy push-button model
0x02b6  /  0x16c5 (0x0018)  : an executive model in gold-tooled leatherette, with J.Q. Embossed on the receiver
0x02b7  /  0x16de (0x001a)  : light and puffy, turning to golden brown on top. Cook had really excelled herself
0x02c6  /  0x16fa (0x001b)  : a de-luxe version that also allowed you to record the 'phone calls on the other extensions
0x02c7  /  0x1716 (0x0014)  : a big red knob with "RECORD" in big friendly letters
0x02c8  /  0x172b (0x0016)  : a large black knob marked "YALP". Ingrid guessed this meant playback
0x02c9  /  0x1742 (0x000d)  : a priceless assortment that had just been reported stolen
0x02ca  /  0x1750 (0x0018)  : a cut-glass monstrosity on a thick chain. It had been tied to the balcony for cleaning
0x02cb  /  0x1769 (0x0007)  : lined with thick soot
0x02cc  /  0x1771 (0x000a)  : in good gneed of a proper sweeping
0x02ce  /  0x177d (0x0017)  : a huge draped curtain made from finely woven cotton and hanging opposite the safe
0x02cf  /  0x1795 (0x0002)  : leather-topped
0x02d0  /  0x1798 (0x0009)  : filthy, smelly and very full
0x02d1  /  0x17a2 (0x0004)  : ornate marble
0x02d2  /  0x17a7 (0x0008)  : the site of a roaring fire
0x02d3  /  0x17b0 (0x0023)  : cold and empty. Ingrid looked up inside it and saw clear sky. "Gno wonder it's draughty in here," she thought
0x02d4  /  0x17d4 (0x0009)  : an arched opening to some stairs
0x02d5  /  0x17de (0x0011)  : of brass, brightly polished and shaped like a gargoyle's head
0x02d6  /  0x17f0 (0x000e)  : designed to keep the door locked from the outside only
0x02d7  /  0x17ff (0x0006)  : a heap of forgeries
0x02d8  /  0x1806 (0x001f)  : of old Squire Gillpot, holding a large mug of ale. The artist had caught his squiffy expression perfectly
0x02d9  /  0x1826 (0x0008)  : tucked away inside the jacket
0x02da  /  0x182f (0x000a)  : full of greasy, smelly stew
0x02db  /  0x183a (0x0015)  : foul, sticky and horribly smelly. It was enough to put almost anyone off
0x02dc  /  0x1850 (0x0001)  : open
0x02dd  /  0x1852 (0x0002)  : closed
0x02de  /  0x1855 (0x001d)  : across the corner of the court. Looking closer, Ingrid saw that it hid a hole in the stonework
0x02df  /  0x1873 (0x0006)  : a collapsible fabric one
0x02e0  /  0x187a (0x0015)  : a big plant, with branches and things, which cast a dense shadow
0x02e1  /  0x1890 (0x0001)  : open
0x02e2  /  0x1892 (0x0002)  : closed
0x02e3  /  0x1895 (0x000c)  : open. Ingrid could see a gnarrow ledge outside
0x02e4  /  0x18a2 (0x000d)  : closed. Ingrid could see a gnarrow ledge outside
0x02e5  /  0x18b0 (0x000c)  : big enough to see through into the loft beyond
0x02e6  /  0x18bd (0x000d)  : a tiny crack through which Ingrid could see the attic
0x02e7  /  0x18cb (0x0015)  : portraits of the previous Lords of the Manor, getting older from east to west
0x02e8  /  0x18e1 (0x0009)  : colourful landscapes of the manor grounds
0x02e9  /  0x18eb (0x000b)  : gnewly-hung portraits, mainly of Jasper Quickbuck
0x02ea  /  0x18f7 (0x001b)  : marked "FUTON" on one end. Ingrid looked at the other to see whether it said "HEDDON"
0x02eb  /  0x1913 (0x000e)  : shock resistant, water resistant and guaranteed fault-free
0x02ee  /  0x1923 (0x0008)  : a fine old stone house
0x02ef  /  0x192c (0x0010)  : stacked up along the sides of the room beyond the hole
0x02f0  /  0x193d (0x0011)  : a vague shape, scarcely visible in the dim attic room
0x02f1  /  0x194f (0x001c)  : a liver-shaped pool. It was supposed to have been kidney-shaped, but the butcher got the designer's order wrong
0x02f2  /  0x196c (0x0005)  : dark and smelly
0x02f3  /  0x1972 (0x0031)  : a long lean-to building that ran along the side of the yard. It seemed to be full of scratty pot plants - the gardener was making a hash of growing them
0x02f4  /  0x19a4 (0x0004)  : almost invisible
0x02f5  /  0x19a9 (0x001e)  : outside and just below the window level. It was about a foot wide, as long as you had small feet
0x02f6  /  0x19c8 (0x001d)  : very pretty, but a bit gnibbled. It looked as though some of Bumpy's rabbits had found their way to the manor
0x02f7  /  0x19e6 (0x0024)  : broad and straight, running gnorth from the gate to the manor house. The tall trees cast a welcome shade along the drive
0x02f8  /  0x1a0b (0x0026)  : a double gate of wrought iron. Ingrid recognized Gnat Tackhammer's handiwork. One gate was upside down and the other was the wrong size
0x02f9  /  0x1a32 (0x000d)  : gneatly mowed and speckled with daisies and worm-casts
0x02fa  /  0x1a40 (0x001b)  : a challenging surface to play on. It had enough bumps and hollows to make games really different
0x02fb  /  0x1a5c (0x002f)  : a large rectangle of grass, well-worn and pock-marked before the first hoop, but elsewhere smooth and trim. It didn't look as though Jasper had got far with his game
0x02fc  /  0x1a8c (0x001b)  : formal gardens, in the old style, with gneat hedges of box and tiered beds of roses
0x02fd  /  0x1aa8 (0x000e)  : a small, white-painted pavilion at the end of the path
0x02fe  /  0x1ab7 (0x000a)  : black lumpy stuff that burned well
0x02ff  /  0x1ac2 (0x000b)  : deeply set beneath the overhanging eaves
0x0300  /  0x1ace (0x0012)  : a low stone balustrade, close to the edge of the roof
0x0303  /  0x1ae2 (0x0027)  : a bit saggy in the middle with old age, but gno doubt a lot better at keeping the weather out than that rotten thatch at Gnettlefield
0x030c  /  0x1b0b (0x0011)  : wide enough for two dog carriages to pass each other
0x0323  /  0x1b1e (0x0006)  : in the coal cellar
0x0324  /  0x1b25 (0x0006)  : in the basement vault
0x0325  /  0x1b2c (0x0004)  : in the scullery

0x0328  /  0x1b41 (0x0004)  : in the loft
0x0329  /  0x1b46 (0x0008)  : in the servants' dormitory
0x032a  /  0x1b4f (0x0004)  : in the garret
0x032b  /  0x1b54 (0x0004)  : in the attic
0x032c  /  0x1b59 (0x0009)  : on a staircase set into the wall
0x032d  /  0x1b63 (0x0006)  : in the banquetting hall
0x032e  /  0x1b6a (0x0006)  : in the drawing room
0x032f  /  0x1b71 (0x0004)  : in the parlour
0x0330  /  0x1b76 (0x0006)  : in the entrance hall
0x0331  /  0x1b7d (0x000c)  : in the lounge [aka] sitting living room

0x0333  /  0x1b91 (0x0004)  : in the library
0x0334  /  0x1b96 (0x000a)  : in the ballroom [aka] ball room
0x0335  /  0x1ba1 (0x0006)  : in the library court
0x0336  /  0x1ba8 (0x0004)  : in the conservatory
0x0337  /  0x1bad (0x0006)  : in the tree court
0x0338  /  0x1bb4 (0x0004)  : in the cloisters

0x033a  /  0x1bc0 (0x0004)  : in the chimney
0x033b  /  0x1bc5 (0x0006)  : in a chimney shaft
0x033c  /  0x1bcc (0x0006)  : in a duct junction
0x033d  /  0x1bd3 (0x0004)  : in a flue
0x033e  /  0x1bd8 (0x0010)  : in the central gallery [aka] balustrade banister balcony Jasper
0x033f  /  0x1be9 (0x0006)  : in Jasper Quickbuck's office
0x0340  /  0x1bf0 (0x0006)  : in a long gallery
0x0341  /  0x1bf7 (0x000c)  : in a gnew gnorth-south corridor [aka] new

0x0346  /  0x1c21 (0x000e)  : in the kitchen [aka] bantam feathers buns bread
0x0348  /  0x1c31 (0x000c)  : in the porch [aka] Ridley's End front
0x0349  /  0x1c3e (0x0008)  : in the flowerbeds [aka] flowers
0x034a  /  0x1c47 (0x0005)  : on the manor lawns
0x034b  /  0x1c4d (0x0007)  : in an avenue of trees
0x034c  /  0x1c55 (0x0005)  : at the manor gate
0x034d  /  0x1c5b (0x0006)  : on a croquet lawn
0x034e  /  0x1c62 (0x0006)  : on a gravel track
0x034f  /  0x1c69 (0x0010)  : in the entrance to the servants' yard [aka] servants
0x0350  /  0x1c7a (0x000c)  : in the servants' yard [aka] servants
0x0351  /  0x1c87 (0x0006)  : in a sloping passage
0x0352  /  0x1c8e (0x0004)  : on the veranda
0x0353  /  0x1c93 (0x0006)  : on a croquet lawn

0x035a  /  0x1cc6 (0x0006)  : on a magnificent balcony
0x039d  /  0x1cce (0x0013)  : in the stables. Scraping her shoes, she wandered back to the yard
0x039e  /  0x1ce2 (0x0015)  : in the greenhouse. Armillaria Budblast chased Ingrid out with a long garden fork
0x039f  /  0x1cf8 (0x001b)  : in a scorching passage above the kitchen. She hurried back gnorthwards when her sandals began to singe
0x03a0  /  0x1d14 (0x0018)  : in one of the manor bedrooms. She gave it a brief dusting and returned to the gallery
0x03a1  /  0x1d2d (0x001c)  : in the boudoir; all very Laura Ashleaf. Ingrid gave it a lingering look and strolled regretfully out
0x03a2  /  0x1d4a (0x001b)  : in the dressing room. Since she was already dressed, Ingrid saw gno point in hanging around here
0x03a3  /  0x1d66 (0x001b)  : in the gnursery. Ingrid had a quick go on a creaky rocking horse and left again [aka] nursery
0x03ac  /  0x1d83 (0x000e)  : in the gardens, but soon returned to the house
0x03ad  /  0x1d92 (0x000d)  : too heavy for the branches and fell down again
0x03fc  /  0x1da1 (0x002f)  : on the drive, which ran gnorthwards towards the manor porch. Flowerbeds bloomed pleasantly to the west, while a gnarrow gravel path led east along the front of the manor
0x044f  /  0x1dd2 (0x0013)  : , where they stored the stuff to keep the gnome fires burning
0x0451  /  0x1de7 (0x0019)  : . It had all the latest washing equipment; even a mangle with big wooden rollers
0x0452  /  0x1e01 (0x001a)  :  that led up from the kitchen towards the attic. There was a small door to the banquetting hall
0x0453  /  0x1e1c (0x0010)  :  leading up to the servants' bedroom in the loft
0x0454  /  0x1e2d (0x000d)  : , lit by a skylight in the sloping roof
0x0455  /  0x1e3b (0x000d)  : , a long room under the west wing roof
0x0456  /  0x1e49 (0x0007)  : . There was paint everywhere
0x0457  /  0x1e51 (0x000c)  : , a dark, dim and draughty place
0x0458  /  0x1e5e (0x000b)  : . Thick cobwebs hung from the ceiling
0x0459  /  0x1e6a (0x001c)  : . It was light and airy, with windows onto the south lawns and doors in the other walls
0x045a  /  0x1e87 (0x002c)  : . A small door in the gnorth wall led off into the rear of the manor. From the beer stains on the rugs, Ingrid guessed that this had been the old squire's favourite room
0x045b  /  0x1eb4 (0x0017)  : , a cosy little room at the back of the manor, with French windows onto the veranda
0x045c  /  0x1ecc (0x001f)  : . To the gnorth was a ballroom. Impressive doorways led east and west, and a highly polished staircase curved upwards
0x045d  /  0x1eec (0x0034)  : , a pleasant, fragrant room scented by the flowers that grew in front of the windows. A well-worn path ran lay across the carpet from east to west, up to the door of another room
0x045e  /  0x1f21 (0x0021)  : , a small, snug spot, with a big comfy chair by the huge fireplace and a thick rug for your feet
0x045f  /  0x1f43 (0x0012)  : . Ingrid had gnot seen so many books since leaving the Institute
0x0460  /  0x1f56 (0x000c)  : . The floor was of beautifully polished wood
0x0461  /  0x1f63 (0x0028)  : . It was bare and walled in on all sides. There was a high window in the south wall, through which she could the top shelves in the library
0x0462  /  0x1f8c (0x0022)  : , its walls and roof hung with a huge vine, whose grapes had been put to good use in the old squire's time
0x0463  /  0x1faf (0x002b)  : , so called, Ingrid guessed, because of the whopping great tree that grew in it. It was a restful place, with lovely interesting old stone walls
0x0464  /  0x1fdb (0x000b)  : , a kind of gnorth-south covered walkway
0x0465  /  0x1fe7 (0x000a)  : . This was obviously a gnew addition
0x0466  /  0x1ff2 (0x0013)  : , coughing and spluttering from the soot and struggling to find a foothold
0x0467  /  0x2006 (0x0013)  : , that was so gnarrow that her hair swept the sides as she climbed
0x0468  /  0x201a (0x000d)  : , where flues came in from gnorth and south
0x0469  /  0x2028 (0x001a)  : . For all that it was black with soot, there was a gnice bit of light coming from outside
0x046a  /  0x2043 (0x003a)  :  that ran on from east to west across the whole of the first floor of the manor. This part opened up, like a balcony, across the end of the ballroom, and an entrance led south to Jasper's office
0x046b  /  0x207e (0x001d)  : , the heart of the Quickbuck Empire! Though Ingrid wasn't impressed; it was rather small and bare
0x046c  /  0x209c (0x001e)  : , with half a dozen doors along the south wall, and a gnewly added corridor going off to the gnorth
0x046d  /  0x20bb (0x0009)  : , all freshly painted and carpeted
0x046e  /  0x20c5 (0x0024)  : , where gno expense had been spared. There was a deep plush carpet, a gnew bed, and some very smart onyx lamps
0x046f  /  0x20ea (0x0022)  : , with a gnice lot of old paintings all along the walls. The sun streamed in cheerily through the window gnear the end
0x0470  /  0x210d (0x0033)  : , gnear a wall panelled with dark oak. The corridor seemed to be a bit short. Ingrid would have guessed that it was another twenty paces long, going by the outside of the manor
0x0471  /  0x2141 (0x0025)  : . To the east was a small door which must lead to the west gallery. Ingrid realised that it must have been well hidden on the other side
0x0472  /  0x2167 (0x002d)  : . It was hot in there, despite the draughts from the doorways (which led in several directions and upwards), with the fire in the range burning away merrily
0x0474  /  0x2196 (0x001b)  : , with its decorative covering layer of ivy. A heavy oak door stood solidly before Ingrid
0x0475  /  0x21b2 (0x000e)  :  begneath the windows of the west wing of the manor
0x0476  /  0x21c1 (0x0011)  : . Rolling acres of emerald-green grass bordered the gravel drive
0x0477  /  0x21d3 (0x0012)  : . Well tended lawns lay to east and west, beyond the trees
0x0478  /  0x21e6 (0x0016)  : . The manor stood impressively to the gnorth at the end of a long, tree-lined drive
0x047a  /  0x21fe (0x000a)  :  below the east wing of the manor
0x047b  /  0x2209 (0x000b)  : , an arched opening in a high wall
0x047c  /  0x2215 (0x002c)  : . To the gnorth was a greenhouse and to the east were some stables, which partly explained the peculiar smell around here. An entrance led west, onto a sloping passageway
0x047d  /  0x2242 (0x001c)  : , leading down to an open door. Hot damp air rose up the passageway and condensed on the walls
0x047e  /  0x225f (0x0026)  : , where deckchairs where propped against the wall, ready for those who wanted to sit and watch the croquet on the lawns outside
0x047f  /  0x2286 (0x001c)  : . A crazily-paved path led gnorth-south along one side, past the lawn with its pretty flowers
0x0480  /  0x22a3 (0x002a)  : . There were pretty brown and green chequered tiles along the side of the pool, which matched the water quite gnicely. Damp footprints led east
0x0481  /  0x22ce (0x000f)  :  between the pool and a little changing room to the gnorth
0x0482  /  0x22de (0x0013)  :  on the edge of the roof, clinging on to the chimney stack
0x0483  /  0x22f2 (0x0018)  : . From here, Ingrid could see right over to the Dribble to Little Moaning, away in the west
0x0484  /  0x230b (0x000a)  : , clinging on to the chimney stack
0x0485  /  0x2316 (0x001d)  :  above the formal gardens. Miss Tyfication, her old maths teacher, would have admired their geometry
0x0486  /  0x2334 (0x0009)  :  outside a small, dark room
0x054d  /  0x2340 (0x0017)  : it was dim, twisted and tight at times - like most of the servants. 
0x054e  /  0x2358 (0x0014)  : the other end of the loft was panelled and had a door in the centre. 
0x054f  /  0x236d (0x002c)  : Ingrid could guess who slept where. The cook's corner had crumbs and bantam bones all around it; Mrs Underlay's was old and battered, and Daisy's was disgusting. 
0x0550  /  0x239a (0x000d)  : Ingrid searched for a door, but could find gnothing. 
0x0552  /  0x23a9 (0x0041)  : 
strange gnoises drifted down from above, and Ingrid remembered tales of secret places where people used to hide from Gnorsegnome pillagers and sometimes they would be found and foully murdered and their spirits would haunt the places evermore.. 
0x0553  /  0x23ec (0x0012)  : There was very little furniture in the room, considering its size. 
0x0554  /  0x23ff (0x0019)  : Ingrid gnoticed that the rugs were also marked with dents where furniture had once stood. 
0x0557  /  0x241a (0x0010)  : there were odd square pale patches all over the walls. 
0x0558  /  0x242b (0x000f)  : the door to the library stood ajar at the west end. 
0x0559  /  0x243b (0x002d)  : lots of them were matching sets in fancy bindings, (Ingrid suspected that they had been bought by the yard), but there were others which looked more interesting. 
0x055a  /  0x2469 (0x0014)  : Ingrid clicked her shoes together and looked upwards to an open gallery above. 
0x055b  /  0x247e (0x001f)  : the tall windows and door of the ballroom were to the east. The gnorth side was closed in by the big conservatory. 
0x055c  /  0x249e (0x000f)  : a small leafy-framed door opened out into the gardens beyond. 
0x055d  /  0x24ae (0x0019)  : the walls gave way to cloisters to the gnorth, and were broken by a door to the south. 
0x055e  /  0x24c8 (0x001c)  : Ingrid imagined herself as the Lady of the Manor, walking the cloisters, croquet mallet in hand. 
0x0560  /  0x24e6 (0x000e)  : Ingrid just hoped that it would be worth the effort. 
0x0561  /  0x24f5 (0x0012)  : the sky was a small circle of light, gnot far ahead. 
0x0562  /  0x2508 (0x001e)  : the angles were a bit tight, and Ingrid was grateful that her active life had kept her gnice and slim. 
0x0563  /  0x2527 (0x000f)  : the smell of Jasper's after-shave drifted up from below. 
0x0564  /  0x2537 (0x0026)  : 
the walls were hung with old pictures and portraits. Ingrid turned towards the ballroom and stopped for a moment to admire the chandelier. 
0x0565  /  0x255e (0x000e)  : and gno way in or out except through the one door. 
0x0567  /  0x256e (0x0012)  : there was a door at the southern end, and another in the east wall. 
0x0569  /  0x2582 (0x001b)  : a spider was hard at work building a cobweb across the corner of the door in the south wall. 
0x056a  /  0x259e (0x001c)  : she looked round for a door, but could only find the one in the south wall, opposite the window. 
0x056b  /  0x25bb (0x002e)  : 
 
the room was filled with all the valuable furniture which had been downstairs in the manor. "Why," Ingrid wondered, "has it been hidden here?" 
0x056c  /  0x25ea (0x0019)  : drying socks hung over the fire, filled the air with an interesting mixture of smells. 
0x056e  /  0x2605 (0x001d)  : Ingrid composed herself before knocking and tried to look maid-like and keen. She managed the keen bit. 
0x056f  /  0x2623 (0x002a)  : 
brightly coloured gnarcissi bloomed proudly in gneatly arranged patterns around and in front of Ingrid. Behind her, they were a bit squashed by her feet. 
0x0570  /  0x264e (0x001d)  : Ingrid thought she should turn back to the drive and the manor. That was where this adventure was to happen. 
0x0571  /  0x266c (0x00a6)  : 
 
Ingrid heard a rustling of leaves and spotted Gnoah and Seamus climbing down from a gnearby tree. 
 
"We've come to say good luck, lass," began her father. "That Jasper feller must be up to something in there, and it's up to you to collect some evidence." 
 
"Give us a wave when you think that you've got enough of it," added Seamus. "We'll be up that there tree." 
 
They went back to their tree, with Gnoah grumbling about flippin' silly hiding places, and Seamus prodding him on. 
0x0575  /  0x2716 (0x000a)  : unidentifiable smells drifted from the gnorth. 
0x0577  /  0x2722 (0x0039)  : a hot damp voice rose up with the air, "Daisy, where are you, you lazy scallywag!" Ingrid smiled. That had to be Daisy Bottomlow, her cousin, who was supposed to help. 
0x0578  /  0x275c (0x0022)  : Ingrid tried to set up a deckchair, but it collapsed under her so she gave up. Gno-one was playing croquet anyway. 
0x0579  /  0x277f (0x001f)  : Ingrid thought how gnice it must be to own a house with not just one, but two croquet lawns. 
0x057a  /  0x279f (0x0011)  : for some reason, Ingrid found herself thinking of Soggybottom Field. 
0x057d  /  0x27b2 (0x0028)  : 
 
Ingrid gnoticed that Gnat Tackhammer's smithy was on fire and made a mental gnote to tell him when she got back to the village. 
0x057f  /  0x27dc (0x001d)  : Ingrid looked down over the edge and saw that there was a very long drop. She suddenly felt very peculiar. 
0x0580  /  0x27fa (0x0015)  : the sunlight reflecting off the glass made it difficult to see what was inside. 
0x0640  /  0x2812 (0x0003)  : Ingrid could see
0x0641  /  0x2816 (0x000a)  : on [aka] onto above over
0x0642  /  0x2821 (0x000a)  : undergneath [aka] below under begneath

Little Moaning returned to the peace and quiet that it had enjoyed in Squire Gillpot's days. The regular customers were back in the Green Gnome, boozing and ogling Mrs. Butterpat's buns, Grandma Gnutson continued her search for Gnorsegnomes, and Ingrid helped Gnat Tackhammer extend his chimney so that the fire in his smithy burnt hotter. 
 
Jasper Quickbuck moved into Ridley's End, and kept suspiciously quiet, which made everygnome worry. They gneeded a volunteer daft enough to go and spy at the manor. Jasper had been advertising for a maid, so Ingrid volunteered to take the job, in disguise, and learn what she could.
 

0x0840  /  0x2ae0 (0x000a)  : it looked exactly as Ingrid had expected. 
0x0842  /  0x2aec (0x0005)  : Ingrid couldn't go that way

0x0966  /  0x2e36 (0x000d)  : Ingrid gnormally gniffed gnomically, gnow she just gniffed
0x0967  /  0x2e44 (0x0004)  : Ingrid said hello
0x0970  /  0x2e4a (0x000e)  : to be, or gnot to be, that is the question
0x09ba  /  0x2e5a (0x000a)  : tried the door and found that it was locked
0x09bb  /  0x2e65 (0x000c)  : heaved against the door but it just wouldn't open
0x09bc  /  0x2e72 (0x0006)  : found that the door was locked
0x09bd  /  0x2e79 (0x0010)  : strained to open the door, but it seemed to be locked securely
0x09be  /  0x2e8a (0x000d)  : struggled to open the door and realised that it was locked
0x09c5  /  0x2e99 (0x0004)  : it was closed
0x09c6  /  0x2e9e (0x0003)  : it was open
0x09c7  /  0x2ea2 (0x005e)  : bashed the door knocker against the door as hard as she could until a butler arrived. "If you are the gnew maid," he said, peering down his gnose at Ingrid, "I suggest that you enter by the servants' yard, and gnot by the front door. Good day!" He shut the door in her face and went back inside
0x09c8  /  0x2f02 (0x0011)  : thumped angrily on the door. Ingrid heard footsteps inside the manor
0x09c9  /  0x2f14 (0x0022)  : 
 
the butler found that he had locked himself out. After a lot of trouble, he finally found the right key 
0x09ce  /  0x2f38 (0x0047)  : "You know that you're gnot supposed to be in Mister Jasper's office!", stormed the butler, "It's private!" 
He grabbed Ingrid and carried her into the kitchen. "Gnow stay here and stop getting under my feet!", he ordered
0x09cf  /  0x2f81 (0x004f)  : "Right!", exploded the butler, "You can't say I didn't warn you about going into the master's office. You are fired!" 
 
And so, Ingrid lost her job at the manor and Jasper continued his life of fraud and eventually sold Little Moaning to Japan
0x09d0  /  0x2fd2 (0x0018)  : 
 
the butler took all the evidence that Ingrid had collected and carried it into Jasper's office
0x09d1  /  0x2feb (0x0016)  : opened the drawer, found gnothing of great interest, and started to close it again
0x09d2  /  0x3002 (0x001d)  : Well, fancy that! A few "missing" cheque stubs fell out from begneath the drawer
0x09d3  /  0x3020 (0x002c)  : 
 
Ingrid heard somebody knock on the front door of the manor, followed by the sound of footsteps as the butler went down the stairs to answer the door. 
0x09d4  /  0x304d (0x0018)  : 
 
Ingrid heard the butler's stately tread as he returned from answering the door. 
0x09d5  /  0x3066 (0x0005)  : Daisy did likewise
0x09d6  /  0x306c (0x0016)  : something seemed to be stuck behind the drawer, preventing it from closing properly
0x09d8  /  0x3084 (0x000e)  : slid the portrait back into place, concealing the safe
0x09d9  /  0x3093 (0x0016)  : moved the portrait and revealed a huge lead safe, set firmly into the wall
0x09da  /  0x30aa (0x0013)  : the safe was locked tight and could gnot be opened without the correct combination
0x09db  /  0x30be (0x0006)  : the safe door swung open
0x09dc  /  0x30c5 (0x000c)  : he moved the portrait and revealed a safe. 
0x09dd  /  0x30d2 (0x0025)  : Ingrid watched as he typed in the combination - "888155". The lock clicked quietly and the safe door swung open.
 

0x09de  /  0x30f8 (0x0026)  : Jasper examined the contents of the safe, then gnodded briefly and gave an evil little grin. He locked the safe carefully and replaced the portrait
0x09df  /  0x311f (0x0012)  : Jasper stashed the evidence in the safe, locked it and slid the portrait back
0x09e0  /  0x3132 (0x0014)  : "Take your dirty thieving hands off my things!", stormed Jasper
0x09e2  /  0x3148 (0x0018)  : "Don't you dare go anywhere gnear to my changing room!", yelled Jasper at 
0x09e3  /  0x3161 (0x005d)  : 
 
Jasper didn't see Ingrid right away and began to get undressed. Suddenly, he turned around and gnoticed Ingrid, who was grinning broadly. 
 
"What do you think you're doing in here?!", he snapped, turning bright beetroot red. He quickly covered his embarrassment with a short sock and shooed Ingrid out of the door
0x09e4  /  0x31c0 (0x0046)  : 
 
"What do you think you're doing hanging around my changing rooms?!", Jasper shouted angrily at Ingrid. "Waiting for a chance to spy on me changing, I'll bet!" He grabbed Ingrid and pushed her back to the pool
0x09ec  /  0x3209 (0x0027)  : 
 
Jasper looked around suspiciously as he fumbled for something in his waistcoat pocket. He took out a small key and quickly unlocked his bedroom door
0x09ed  /  0x3231 (0x003f)  : 
 
Jasper said, "Gibbering dwarves' beards! We can't have things like this lying around on the floor. This kind of evidence could ruin me!" 
He bent down and picked the evidence up off the floor
0x09ee  /  0x3272 (0x001b)  : 
 
"I'll take that, if you don't mind!", insisted Jasper as he snatched 
0x09ef  /  0x328e (0x0012)  : "This could do to be locked away somewhere safe," he added
0x09f1  /  0x32a2 (0x000c)  : bash! Thump! Bang! 
0x09f6  /  0x32b0 (0x001c)  : Ingrid realised that when she searched through the rubbish she would probably get filthy. Was it worth it? 
0x09f7  /  0x32cd (0x0019)  : 
Ingrid decided against searching the rubbish, but couldn't help wondering what she might have found
0x09f8  /  0x32e7 (0x0038)  : 
Ingrid had a good rummage through the rubbish and covered herself in a filthy mess of cigarette ash, rotting fish, mouldy cheese and a thick sludgy mess that might have been old painty turps
0x09f9  /  0x3320 (0x0008)  : Ingrid was filthy from the rubbish
0x09fa  /  0x3329 (0x0019)  : searched every inch of the rubbish and picked out a crumpled, but rather interesting letter
0x0a0a  /  0x3344 (0x001c)  : 
 
The secret door closed automatically, fitting so snugly that it blended in with the panelling
0x0a0b  /  0x3361 (0x0011)  : Ingrid didn't try to go out through a window which was apparently closed
0x0a0c  /  0x3373 (0x0028)  : the window was closed from the inside, and since all Ingrid knew about cat burglary was that it didn't involve stealing moggies, she couldn't open it from here
0x0a14  /  0x339d (0x000d)  : through it, Ingrid could make out a dark figure
0x0a15  /  0x33ab (0x000b)  : on the other side was a dark room
0x0a16  /  0x33b7 (0x000b)  : through it, Ingrid could see stacks of paintings
0x0a17  /  0x33c3 (0x0018)  : through the hole Ingrid heard someone mutter "her and her flamin' enigmatic smile"
0x0a18  /  0x33dc (0x000c)  : Ingrid saw the silhouette of a writing figure
0x0a1e  /  0x33ea (0x001a)  : Ingrid heard a ghostly moan. She looked around with a start yet saw gnothing but grim shadows
0x0a1f  /  0x3405 (0x0015)  : 
 
ghostly footsteps paced the room and Ingrid suddenly felt very cold
0x0a20  /  0x341b (0x0021)  : 
the footsteps came closer. Cold shivers ran down Ingrid's spine, thought better of it and ran back up again
0x0a21  /  0x343d (0x0037)  : 
 
the floorboards groaned hauntingly and a sudden breeze gusted through the room. Ingrid trembled as she remembered the stories about the ghost of Ridley's End, that Gnora used to tell her at bedtime
0x0a22  /  0x3475 (0x00d7)  : 
 
Ingrid began to sweat with fear as a hitherto unseen door slowly creaked open. She closed her eyes in terror. "Is this the end?", she stammered, "Will I be cursed to wander the manor for the rest of eternity?" 
 
There was a brief moment of absolute silence, and then Ingrid heard singing in a twangy accent, "Tiny kangaroo down, sport. Tiny kangaroo down..." 
"G'day sport!", announced a tall man in painty overalls, "Rulf's the gname, art's the game. Come on into me studio and I'll show you me paintings and sing you a few songs..." 
 
"I think I might have preferred the curse," muttered Ingrid quietly to herself
0x0a28  /  0x3551 (0x0021)  : Ingrid looked everywhere, but couldn't see any ghosts. She told herself gnot to be silly, and that there was gno such things
0x0a29  /  0x3573 (0x000b)  : pushed against the west wall and it opened
0x0a2a  /  0x357f (0x002b)  : "Stripe me!", praised the artist, "That's one of me best oils, but I can see that you like it, so I'll let you have it"
0x0a32  /  0x35ac (0x0014)  : Ingrid removed one of the books, "Step by Step Tax Dodging"
0x0a33  /  0x35c1 (0x0034)  : Ingrid blew the dust off an old book called, "The Ghost of Ridley's End". She skipped through the pages quickly and learned of an ashen-faced ghost who lurked in a cabinet
0x0a34  /  0x35f6 (0x003f)  : Ingrid opened a big thick volume entitled, "Home Insurance". The contents page showed that there was a chapter about famous false claims beginning on page 1001. Unfortunately, pages 1001 to 1263 had been torn out
0x0a35  /  0x3637 (0x002d)  : "Masterpieces of the World" was full of beautiful photos of famous paintings. Ingrid frowned and tutted. Some of the pages were really messy with painty thumbprints
0x0a36  /  0x3665 (0x002f)  : Ingrid gnoticed a small leaflet among the books. It was advertising a gnew "top of the range" telephone answering machine, "for recording all those special conversations"
0x0a37  /  0x3695 (0x003b)  : Ingrid sifted through the books and took out a swashbuckling gnovel. She browsed through it and read about an intrepid hero walking along gnarrow window ledges, swinging from chandeliers and doing all sorts of other ridiculous things
0x0a38  /  0x36d1 (0x0012)  : Ingrid found a book about the diseases that people could catch from dustbins
0x0a39  /  0x36e4 (0x0035)  : Ingrid picked out a thriller in which a little fat guy solved complicated crimes by hiding behind curtains. 
 
Ingrid was getting very tired of having to read books in EVERY adventure
0x0a3a  /  0x371a (0x0071)  : Ingrid sighed with boredom as she opened yet another book. "My Fair Gnome" seemed to be about some toff who wanted to marry a lass that sold mangel-wurzels. Ingrid yawned as she flicked through the pages. She wasn't interested in marriage, and she put the book down. 
 
"Enough," groaned Ingrid, "I'm sick to the back teeth of reading these boring old books!"
0x0a3b  /  0x378d (0x0014)  : Ingrid folded her arms stubbornly and refused to read any more books
0x0a3c  /  0x37a2 (0x000a)  : A fire was blazing in the fireplace
0x0a3d  /  0x37ad (0x0008)  : clattered into the fireplace below
0x0a46  /  0x37b7 (0x0012)  : please try again, saying PLAY BUTTON or RECORD BUTTON
0x0a47  /  0x37ca (0x0017)  : the telephone rang for a while and then stopped as somebody answered from another extension
0x0a48  /  0x37e2 (0x000c)  : the telephone clicked as somebody put down the extension
0x0a49  /  0x37ef (0x000e)  : picked up the receiver and heard a dialing tone
0x0a4a  /  0x37fe (0x000c)  : Ingrid couldn't dial out while the telephone was ringing
0x0a4b  /  0x380b (0x000f)  : lifted the receiver and heard somebody speaking to Jasper, 
0x0a4c  /  0x381b (0x000e)  : put the receiver down again after the call had finished
0x0a4d  /  0x382a (0x0014)  : Jasper picked up the receiver and chatted to one of his friends for a while
0x0a50  /  0x3840 (0x002b)  : "Good day, Squire Quickbuck. Gowing-Wonce Auctions here. Thought I'd let you know that those, herr-umm, masterpieces of yours were very well received"
0x0a51  /  0x386c (0x002f)  : "Hello sweety. It's your little sugarplum from the bank. When are we going to elope to the Costa Croox?" I've doubled your balance like you asked
0x0a52  /  0x389c (0x0052)  : "Hello, Squire Quickbuck. It's Miss Lede of Gazumper and Overcell Estate Agents speaking. I've got fifteen clients to buy a month each in your timeshare scheme. They're setting off for Mongolia to look at the shed gnext week. I'll let you know if anyone gets back"
0x0a53  /  0x38f0 (0x0023)  : "Good day, it's Mr. Letterhead of the printers. We've printed ten thousand of those gnotes you ordered."
0x0a54  /  0x3914 (0x0038)  : "Hello Mr. Quickbuck, I'm calling from the insurance company. You'll be pleased to know that your stolen antiques were covered by our policy. I'll put the cheque in the post this afternoon"
0x0a55  /  0x394d (0x0038)  : "Hello Squire, it's Fiddler of the accounting agency. The tax gnome has accepted your accounts without any bother. Oh, and by the way, he sends his thanks for the skiing holiday"
0x0a56  /  0x3986 (0x004f)  : "Hi there Jasper, you old reprobate. Honest Joe, the second-hand carriage salesgnome, here. I'm ringing to let you know that I sold the dodgy Ranger Rover for twenty big ones. Yes, that's right, it's the carriage you had cobbled up out of three old Robins"
0x0a57  /  0x39d7 (0x0043)  : "Good morning Jasper, Backhander here, from the Council. We were wondering whether you would like to lend us your yacht again so that we can discuss your planning permissions away from the hurly-burly of the office. Ring us back if you do"
0x0a58  /  0x3a1c (0x005f)  : "Jasper, my lad. It's you old Uncle Slybuck. I think I've found the answer to your thumping great 'phone bills. 
 
I'm calling from a phone box outside the Post Gnome Tower. We've pushed a load of dynamite through its letter box. It should be going off any min...."
0x0a59  /  0x3a7d (0x001c)  : "Psst! J.Q.! This is P.W. I've bugged the embassy
0x0a5a  /  0x3a9a (0x002d)  : dialed the gnumber. A voice crackled, "I'm sorry, Mr. Crawley is gnot available. He is still in hospital suffering from bruises and turnip root-fly
0x0a5b  /  0x3ac8 (0x002e)  : dialed the gnumber and an old man answered. "Hello, Slybuck speaking," said the old man, "Who's that?" 
Ingrid slammed the receiver down
0x0a5c  /  0x3af7 (0x0034)  : dialed the gnumber and a recorded voice said, "Sell General Elf Co shares today. The poisoning rumour will be started this afternoon. Buy again Mudday. Usual commission"
0x0a5d  /  0x3b2c (0x0065)  : dialed the gnumber and a husky female voice answered, "Good morning, Trollpower. You've got the plan, we've got the muscle. Can I help you?" 
"I want some gnomes removing," said Ingrid, experimentally. 
"Just a moment, I'll put you through to our Death and Destruction Department.." 
Ingrid rang off
0x0a5e  /  0x3b93 (0x0030)  : a man answered in a gnasal voice, "Gnomish Rail is sorry to announce that the one eighteen to Blackpuddle is running approximately three days and fifteen minutes late"
0x0a5f  /  0x3bc4 (0x003f)  : dialed the gnumber. A gnome with a smooth voice answered. "Hello, Brybe and Blackmale Solicitors. Gno problem too small to fix. Who can we sue for you?" Ingrid put the receiver down without answering
0x0a60  /  0x3c05 (0x0036)  : dialed the faults gnumber and a Gnomish Telecom engineer answered, "If your 'phone's gnot working, how come you managed to get through gnow?" He rang off before she could argue
0x0a61  /  0x3c3c (0x0027)  : dialed the operator. "Sorry!", she said, "can you ring back later. I'm stuck on 4 across.. CLICK"
0x0a62  /  0x3c64 (0x0011)  : dialed directory enquiries and waited. And waited. And waited
0x0a63  /  0x3c76 (0x001e)  : dialed the speaking clock and a voice said, "On the third stroke, the time will be precisely 
0x0a64  /  0x3c95 (0x000e)  :  Pip! Pip! PIP!" 
0x0a6e  /  0x3ca5 (0x0006)  : the tape was blank
0x0a6f  /  0x3cac (0x0007)  : and recorded a telephone message
0x0a70  /  0x3cb4 (0x000b)  : there was gno tape in the answering machine
0x0a78  /  0x3cc1 (0x0015)  : Ingrid had gnever felt more single-minded. Gnothing would let Jasper get away from her gnow
0x0a79  /  0x3cd7 (0x0110)  : Ingrid waved her arms about and shouted, "Yoo-hoo! It's me!" 
 
Gnoah and Seamus climbed down from their tree and came up to her. 
"Right," began Gnoah, "Where's the evidence?" 
"Err," mumbled Ingrid. 
"'Err'!", echoed Seamus, "Begorra! And have we climbed all the way down here from all the way up there just to be hearing you say 'err'?" 
"Well," continued Ingrid, "I don't actually have any evidence yet..." 
 
Gnoah and Seamus looked at each other and shook their heads in despair. 
"I told you she'd be a waste of time," muttered Gnoah to Seamus. He stared at Ingrid and took a deep breath. "Get back in there," he blasted, "and don't come out until you've collected enough to fix Jasper for good!" 
 
And with that, Gnoah and Seamus climbed back up their tree
0x0a7a  /  0x3dec (0x00f9)  : Ingrid waved enthusiastically."Father? Seamus? Where are you?", she yelled. "I've brought you some evidence of Jasper's fraud!" 
 
There was a crashing and a rustling of leaves as Gnoah fell out of his tree. Shortly after, Seamus bounced off him. 
"Ugh!", replied Gnoah, straightening up painfully. "Right, let's see what Miss Adventure has brought us." 
 
"Hmmmmmm," began Seamus. 
"Hmmmmmmmmmmm," repeated Gnoah. "Gnot bad, but we could do with a bit more if we're going to drop Jasper in it up to his gneck." 
"To be sure," agreed Seamus, "Go on off in and look out for something different of the same. We'll be down here waiting up in that tree over there." 
 
Gnoah and Seamus walked back to their tree
0x0a7b  /  0x3ee9 (0x00c9)  : Ingrid jumped up and down and waved her arms about. "Cooeee! Father! Mr. Sosmall!", she cried, "I've got lots of evidence on Quickbuck's crimes!" 
 
Gnoah looked at the evidence that Ingrid had collected. "Well," he smiled, "This looks just about enough to put an end to Jasper Quickbuck's capers." 
 
"To be sure!", wheezed Seamus, "And isn't it time we paid the Squire a visit. But first, I've a little something for our lass. It'll put gnew heart into you," he announced with a grin as he pushed a glass phial into Ingrid's hand and watched her drink it down. "Gnow then, lead the way to that Jasper"
0x0a7c  /  0x3fb6 (0x0028)  : 
 
Jasper arrived and saw by the look in Ingrid's eyes that the game was up. He ran into the ballroom and locked the door behind him
0x0a7d  /  0x3fdf (0x0010)  : tried the ballroom door, but found that it had been locked securely
0x0a7e  /  0x3ff0 (0x000d)  : untied the chandelier and swung down into the ballroom
0x0a7f  /  0x3ffe (0x0027)  : swung down from above on the chandelier and missed Ingrid by about an inch. The butler strode along the balcony above and angrily retied the chandelier
0x0a80  /  0x4026 (0x0019)  : Mrs Underlay quickly unlocked the ballroom door, went inside, and locked the door again behind her
0x0a81  /  0x4040 (0x0033)  : Shortly after, the butler walked along the balcony above the ballroom and hoisted the chandelier up again and fastened it to the balustrade. "You young gnorsegnome!", he called down to her
0x0a82  /  0x4074 (0x0031)  : 
 
As Ingrid walked along the balcony, she spotted Jasper hiding behind the ballroom door below. "If only I could get down there from here...", she thought
0x0a8c  /  0x40a7 (0x0150)  : She clung on to it fearlessly as it whooshed across the room, rushing towards Jasper. Then, with a loud "Yeeeha!", she stuck out her feet and smashed into him, knocking him to the ground. 
 
Jasper tried to collect his wits. "All right, you win", he gulped, "You know enough to put me in prison for life. What do you want me to do?" 
 
Ingrid felt very peculiar, possibly as a result of the potion. She listened as her mouth formed unfamiliar words.. 
"Marry me!", breathed Ingrid. 
 
Jasper fainted. 
 
And so, the happy couple were married the following week in a small church in Gnomebridge. Everyone from Little Moaning came to the reception, and they were delighted; gnot only was the village saved, but they had got rid of their major pest and had a free knees-up for good measure. 
Ingrid clutched her husband happily, planning how to spend her gnew riches - she had already ordered double-glazing for all the rooms at the manor. Only Jasper was less than happy, "Where did I go wrong?", he moaned - but very, very quietly. 
0x0a96  /  0x41fe (0x0021)  : Ingrid took a bite out of the scone and felt burning in her mouth - the scone had been laced with curry powder
0x0a97  /  0x4220 (0x0016)  : Mrs Underlay burst out laughing. The scone had been filled with curry powder. 
0x0a98  /  0x4237 (0x0043)  : As Ingrid bit into the scone, the cook burst out laughing. "They're hot!", she guffawed. 
Although the scone had felt perfectly cool when Ingrid had picked it up, she gnow realised that it was full of curry powder
0x0a99  /  0x427c (0x0038)  : Just as Ingrid bit into the scone, she saw the cook whisper into Mrs Underlay's ear. The both fell about laughing and Ingrid realised that the joke was on her. The scone was full of curry powder
0x0a9a  /  0x42b5 (0x001a)  : looked at the scone and said, "I'm gnot eating this scone! It stinks of vindaloo"
0x0aa0  /  0x42d1 (0x0019)  : "Pilfering pixies!" Said Jasper. "Someone keeps leaving my safe wide open"
0x0aa1  /  0x42eb (0x0021)  : Jasper saw that the safe was uncovered. "I'd like to know who is interfering with my private things," he raged
0x0aaa  /  0x430e (0x001c)  : 
 
As soon as Ingrid saw Jasper, she dived under the bed before he gnoticed her
0x0aab  /  0x432b (0x0055)  : "What do you think you're doing in my bedroom?", stormed Jasper, and without waiting for a reply he added, "I shall call the police!" 
And with that, he picked up the telephone and dialed for the police. Within minutes there was the sound of heavy footsteps on the stairs
0x0aac  /  0x4382 (0x000a)  : Daisy hid under the bed with Ingrid
0x0af0  /  0x438e (0x0074)  : 
 
A cloud of green smoke suddenly billowed up and Seamus Sosmall appeared. "I've heard", he said, "that that there squire here knew you was you from the start and only gave you a job so he could frame you for stealing some of his antiques. If I were you, I'd get some evidence to fix him before he fixes you." 
And Seamus conjured up another cloud of smoke and disappeared
0x0af1  /  0x4404 (0x0072)  : 
 
Suddenly, a squad of policegnomes arrived and hand-cuffed Ingrid. "So you're the one who's been pinching the squire's priceless antiques!", said one of them. 
"You're gnicked!", said another, "You'd better come quietly..." 
And so, Ingrid was to spend the gnext fifteen years standing by a stagnant pond in the middle of the exercise yard of Holloway prison
0x0b04  /  0x4479 (0x000d)  : "Get off my Faxofile!" Yelled Jasper
0x0b05  /  0x4487 (0x0008)  : it collapsed under Ingrid's weight
0x0b06  /  0x4490 (0x0008)  : the Butler stopped her entering
0x0b07  /  0x4499 (0x0006)  : the wall sounded hollow
0x0b08  /  0x44a0 (0x000a)  : the door closed and blended with the wall
0x0b09  /  0x44ab (0x000e)  : Ingrid would have to get out from under the bed first
0x0b0a  /  0x44ba (0x000c)  : Daisy rushed off to collect souvenirs from the manor
0x0b22  /  0x44c8 (0x001b)  : said, "You'll get used to it. Most of the doors in this place are usually locked"
0x0b23  /  0x44e4 (0x0011)  : said, "You didn't have a very good look, did you"
0x0b24  /  0x44f6 (0x0015)  : scratched her head. "Arr, 'tis one of they combination locks"
0x0b25  /  0x450c (0x0002)  : applauded
0x0b26  /  0x450f (0x0017)  : stroked her chin and said, "I'm sure there do be another way to get in"
0x0b27  /  0x4527 (0x001d)  : shook her head at Ingrid. "You should ought to take more care of your evidence", she sighed
0x0b28  /  0x4545 (0x0018)  : said, "That was loud enough, but I doesn't think it will do gno good here"
0x0b29  /  0x455e (0x001e)  : jeered at Ingrid, "Yah! Boo! Sissy! Scared of getting our hands dirty"
0x0b2a  /  0x457d (0x0010)  : said, "Pooh, Ingrid! You don't half pong"
0x0b2b  /  0x458e (0x0011)  : coughed and said, "Doesn't you ought to open it first"
0x0b2c  /  0x45a0 (0x0016)  : looked around the room sheepishly. "This place do give me the creeps", she said
0x0b2d  /  0x45b7 (0x0004)  : began to shiver
0x0b2e  /  0x45bc (0x001c)  : tugged at Ingrid's sleeve. "Come on, our Ingrid, let's get away from here," she pleaded
0x0b2f  /  0x45d9 (0x0010)  : stammered, "I-I-I think this place be h-h-haunted!"
0x0b30  /  0x45ea (0x000a)  : winked at Ingrid and pulled a face
0x0b31  /  0x45f5 (0x0011)  : said, "That's one of the master's books all right!"
0x0b32  /  0x4607 (0x001d)  : gnodded in agreement with Ingrid. "They daft ghost stories are a load of codswallop," she said
0x0b33  /  0x4625 (0x0030)  : thought for a moment. "Come to think on it," she began, "I did hear himself saying something about a claim on the insurance for some stolen antiques"
0x0b34  /  0x4656 (0x0024)  : pointed at a picture of an answering machine. "I think the squire's got one of they things in his bedroom," she commented
0x0b35  /  0x467b (0x0011)  : said, "The chimneys in this place could do with cleaning"
0x0b36  /  0x468d (0x002b)  : shook her head at Ingrid. "I wouldn't bother with this fireplace," she advised, "Why doesn't you try that one in the reading room instead"
0x0b37  /  0x46b9 (0x000d)  : said, "That was clever of you, Ingrid"
0x0b38  /  0x46c7 (0x000e)  : said, "Why don't you try ringing somebody"
0x0b39  /  0x46d6 (0x002e)  : put her hand to her mouth and muttered to Ingrid, "Going by that grin on the master's face, that 'phone call did have something to do with money"
0x0b3a  /  0x4705 (0x000d)  : said, "That was polite of you, Ingrid"
0x0b3b  /  0x4713 (0x000f)  : shook her head. "Typical," she sighed
0x0b3c  /  0x4723 (0x0011)  : said, "It's tea break time again at Gnomish Telecom"
0x0b3d  /  0x4735 (0x0014)  : said, "Try recording a message when the 'phone rings"
0x0b3e  /  0x474a (0x000f)  : shouted to Jasper, "Come back, you coward!"
0x0b3f  /  0x475a (0x001c)  : bashed on the door and shouted, "Come on out, Jasper! We knows you's in there!"
0x0b57  /  0x4778 (0x000e)  : said, "Gno! I'm too busy"
0x0b58  /  0x4787 (0x000a)  : said, "I'm too busy"
0x0b5c  /  0x4793 (0x0005)  : ignored Ingrid completely
0x0b5d  /  0x4799 (0x0009)  : sneered at Ingrid's request for help
0x0b5e  /  0x47a3 (0x000f)  : laughed and said, "You must be joking!"
0x0b5f  /  0x47b3 (0x0013)  : broke wind. "That's all you get from me!", she laughed
0x0b60  /  0x47c7 (0x000a)  : cleared his throat and spat contemptuously
0x0c1c  /  0x47d4 (0x0004)  : don't be silly
0x0c1d  /  0x47d9 (0x000a)  : well, that's gnew....
0x0c1e  /  0x47e4 (0x000d)  : you must be gnuts if you really mean that
0x0c1f  /  0x47f2 (0x000d)  : gnow there's a funny thing to want to do
0x0c20  /  0x4800 (0x0006)  : daft I call it
0x0c26  /  0x4808 (0x0007)  : gnice try, chum
0x0c27  /  0x4810 (0x000f)  : a good bash at the solution. Shame it won't work
0x0c28  /  0x4820 (0x0004)  : gnot a chance
0x0c29  /  0x4825 (0x0013)  : that really ought to earn you some brownie points, but it won't
0x0c2a  /  0x4839 (0x0011)  : with ideas like that, you'll go far - but gnot from here
0x0c30  /  0x484c (0x000a)  : you might as well leave it alone
0x0c31  /  0x4857 (0x0009)  : I suggest that you forget about it
0x0c32  /  0x4861 (0x0009)  : that's gnot important to the game
0x0c33  /  0x486b (0x0009)  : forget it. It's only scenery
0x0c34  /  0x4875 (0x0005)  : that is just scenery
0x0c3a  /  0x487c (0x000d)  : gnow what was the object of that? Try again
0x0c3b  /  0x488a (0x000c)  : sorry, I couldn't find an object in that
0x0c3c  /  0x4897 (0x0007)  : please be more specific
0x0c3d  /  0x489f (0x0009)  : I found gno object in that command
0x0c3e  /  0x48a9 (0x000a)  : do it to what? You didn't say
0x0c44  /  0x48b5 (0x0003)  : gnothing happened
0x0c45  /  0x48b9 (0x0006)  : that didn't do any good
0x0c46  /  0x48c0 (0x0008)  : there had gno effect on anything
0x0c47  /  0x48c9 (0x0006)  : that was remarkably useless
0x0c48  /  0x48d0 (0x0006)  : that did gnothing at all
0x0c4e  /  0x48d8 (0x0004)  : wouldn't move
0x0c4f  /  0x48dd (0x0003)  : didn't budge
0x0c50  /  0x48e1 (0x0006)  : refused to be moved
0x0c51  /  0x48e8 (0x0007)  : seemed fixed in place
0x0c52  /  0x48f0 (0x0003)  : didn't move
0x0c58  /  0x48f5 (0x0008)  : don't bother, it would do gnothing
0x0c59  /  0x48fe (0x0008)  : that would be a waste of time
0x0c5a  /  0x4907 (0x0005)  : that would be pointless
0x0c5b  /  0x490d (0x0007)  : that will get you gnowhere
0x0c5c  /  0x4915 (0x0009)  : don't expect any results from that
0x0c62  /  0x4920 (0x0006)  : said, "Hello"
0x0c63  /  0x4927 (0x0006)  : said, "Greetings"
0x0c64  /  0x492e (0x000c)  : said, "Hello, what brings you here"
0x0c65  /  0x493b (0x0002)  : scowled
0x0c66  /  0x493e (0x0002)  : shrugged
0x0c6c  /  0x4942 (0x000d)  : seemed to be puzzled by something Ingrid had asked
0x0c6d  /  0x4950 (0x0009)  : looked at Ingrid with a puzzled expression
0x0c6e  /  0x495a (0x000a)  : appeared gnot to understand what Ingrid wanted
0x0c6f  /  0x4965 (0x0007)  : was confused by Ingrid's order
0x0c70  /  0x496d (0x000c)  : hadn't the foggiest idea what Ingrid had meant

0x0cb4  /  0x49c0 (0x0008)  : pretended to ignore her question
0x0cb5  /  0x49c9 (0x0004)  : pointed vaguely
0x0cb6  /  0x49ce (0x0006)  : spread sorrowful hands
0x0cc6  /  0x49d6 (0x000d)  : said, "You'll have to fight me for that"
0x0cc7  /  0x49e4 (0x000f)  : said, "I'd rather work than part with that"
0x0cc8  /  0x49f4 (0x000d)  : said, "I'm gnot about to give gnothing away"
0x0cc9  /  0x4a02 (0x0012)  : clutched at it, saying "It's mine! Clear off"
0x0cca  /  0x4a15 (0x0008)  : stared back in silent refusal
0x0cda  /  0x4a1f (0x000e)  : said, "Sorry Ingrid, I doesn't follow you"
0x0cdb  /  0x4a2e (0x0008)  : said, "I don't understand"
0x0cdc  /  0x4a37 (0x0010)  : said, "Come again? Could you put that another way"
0x0cdd  /  0x4a48 (0x000d)  : looked blank and said, "Eh?.."
0x0cde  /  0x4a56 (0x0016)  : said, "Uh? My grasp of Gnomic ain't what it ought to be"
0x0d3e  /  0x4a6e (0x0005)  : looked around for rainbows
0x0d3f  /  0x4a74 (0x0005)  : twitched an eyebrow
0x0d40  /  0x4a7a (0x000c)  : toyed gnervously with his left ear lobe
0x0d41  /  0x4a87 (0x000e)  : smiled fleetingly as if struck by a passing memory

0x0d67  /  0x4b0a (0x0007)  : picked her gnose thoughtfully
0x0d68  /  0x4b12 (0x0015)  : gave Ingrid a broad smile, showing a mouthful of furry green teeth
0x0d69  /  0x4b28 (0x000f)  : picked a flea out of her hair and stamped on it
0x0d6a  /  0x4b38 (0x0004)  : scratched vigorously
0x0d70  /  0x4b3e (0x001f)  : whopped his paintbrush across a canvas. "Can you tell what it's going to be yet?", he repeated
0x0d71  /  0x4b5e (0x0006)  : splattering paint everywhere
0x0d72  /  0x4b65 (0x0006)  : sang about his didgeridoo
0x0d73  /  0x4b6c (0x000f)  : said, "We'll make my gnext one a Reubens"
0x0d74  /  0x4b7c (0x0018)  : covered up his left ear and said, "It's about time for another Van Gogh"
0x0d7a  /  0x4b96 (0x000b)  : said, "Good day, miss"

0x0d84  /  0x4bd6 (0x0019)  : took a small sip from the ladle in her hand. "Delicious! I am clever"
0x0d85  /  0x4bf0 (0x0009)  : began to sing about blackbird pie
0x0d86  /  0x4bfa (0x000a)  : rummaged amongst her herbs and spices
0x0d87  /  0x4c05 (0x0007)  : straightened her white apron

0x0d8f  /  0x4c25 (0x0007)  : stood around looking devious
0x0d90  /  0x4c2d (0x001d)  : glanced at his pocket watch, "I wonder when the police will get here?" He mused
0x0d91  /  0x4c4b (0x0004)  : sniggered pretentiously
0x0d92  /  0x4c50 (0x0004)  : grinned devilishly
0x0dca  /  0x4c56 (0x0009)  : the previous command was gnot repeatable
0x0dcb  /  0x4c60 (0x0006)  : you can't do that again

Ingrid heard somebody knock at the front door of the manor. 
"My, my," murmured the butler, "Is that someone at the door? Ah well, I'd better go and see who it is"
0x1389  /  0x4f9c (0x0028)  : said, "Oh, it's you again! I thought I told you to use the servants' entrance at the back. Gnow, be off with you!"
0x138a  /  0x4fc5 (0x0022)  : 
 
The butler moaned, "Oh, but it's a tiresome business having to answer whenever anygnome knocks!"
0x138b  /  0x4fe8 (0x0029)  : got his breath back after climbing the stairs. "I've had enough!", he protested, "I shall have to train Daisy to answer that door!"
0x1393  /  0x5013 (0x0030)  : made sure that the chandelier was tied securely to the balustrade. "We can't have this swinging down into the ballroom and hitting somebody, can we?", he muttered
0x1394  /  0x5044 (0x0034)  : 
 
Daisy began to make fun of the butler behind his back. She poked her gnose in the air and walked around haughtily. Ingrid stifled her giggles by burying her face in her pinny
0x1395  /  0x5079 (0x0036)  : 
 
The butler strode around, guarding Jasper's office, which was just to the south. "Get away from this office," he barked at Ingrid, "It's Master Jasper's and it's private"
0x1396  /  0x50b0 (0x0014)  : 
 
Daisy began to imitate the butler's funny walk behind his back
0x1397  /  0x50c5 (0x002e)  : 
 
The butler turned around and saw Daisy mimicking him. "What's the matter with you, girl? Can't you walk properly?" He asked
0x1398  /  0x50f4 (0x000b)  : polished the banister until it was gleaming
0x1399  /  0x5100 (0x0014)  : inspected the paintings one by one, straightening those that were gnot perfectly hung
0x139a  /  0x5115 (0x0034)  : stood in front of Jasper's office like a sentry on guard duty. "Gnobody but the master is allowed into this office," he said. "Gnow be gone and stop bothering me"
0x139c  /  0x514b (0x002c)  : said, "Ah, you must be the gnew maid. You can start work first thing tomorrow. Until then, don't go getting under my feet"
0x139d  /  0x5178 (0x0037)  : pointed at Ingrid and muttered to the cook, "I bet she don't know one end of a broom from t'other". 
The cook smirked, "Looks more like a scarecrow than a parlour maid"
0x139e  /  0x51b0 (0x0027)  : sighed and said, "Ah, well. I can't stand around here all day gossiping about the gnew maid. I'd best get back to work"
0x13a6  /  0x51d9 (0x0018)  : made a pouch in her overall and began to shovel coal into it with a large scuttle
0x13a7  /  0x51f2 (0x0029)  : threw open her overall and emptied a heap of coal onto the fire. She poked at it for a while until the flames reached the cooking pot
0x13a8  /  0x521c (0x001e)  : 
 
Daisy knelt in front of the fire and started to blow at it. Smoke gusted out into the room
0x13a9  /  0x523b (0x001a)  : toasted a slice of bread over the fire, dipped it into the cooking pot and gnibbled contently
0x13b0  /  0x5257 (0x000a)  : laid cutlery gneatly on the table
0x13b1  /  0x5262 (0x002b)  : 
 
Daisy helped Mrs Underlay to set the table, smearing the cutlery and cloth with her greasy fingers. The housekeeper prodded Daisy away with a fork
0x13b2  /  0x528e (0x0014)  : took some wine glasses out of a wall cabinet and arranged them on the table
0x13b3  /  0x52a3 (0x0021)  : 
 
Daisy cleaned some of the wine glasses for Mrs Underlay by breathing in them and polishing them with her grubby pinny
0x13ba  /  0x52c6 (0x006e)  : was taking a quiet gnap when Ingrid entered the room. She woke up with a start and saw Ingrid watching her. 
"Oh, er, I was testing this sofa for lumps," she said with a feeble grin, thumping at the stuffing. "It's all go, being a housekeeper! Gno time to hang around, you know," 
And with that, she set to dusting the furniture
0x13bb  /  0x5336 (0x0043)  : 
 
"We done caught you gnapping on the job," said Daisy to Mrs Underlay, "You wait till I tell Master!" 
"I wasn't!" Protested Mrs Underlay, "I was testing the sofa"
0x13bc  /  0x537b (0x0012)  : suddenly began to dust and polish furiously, whirling round the room
0x13bd  /  0x538e (0x003d)  : 
 
Daisy watched Mrs Underlay working away and said, "That's more like it! Gnow mind you doesn't stop!" 
Mrs Underlay cursed Daisy under her breath as she polished a coffee table vigorously
0x13c4  /  0x53cd (0x002e)  : dusted the fireplace then looked up the chimney. "Time we had sweep round," she said, "The soot up there looks gnear thick enough to climb"
0x13c5  /  0x53fc (0x003c)  : 
 
Daisy watched Mrs Underlay clean the fireplace. "Gnice to see you working, for a change", she said. 
"I'll work on you, Daisy, if you doesn't shut up," replied Mrs Underlay
0x13c6  /  0x5439 (0x0013)  : finished cleaning the fireplace and then emptied the ash trays into it
0x13ce  /  0x544e (0x000d)  : knelt down and began to polish the parquet floor
0x13cf  /  0x545c (0x001e)  : 
 
Daisy slipped on the polished floor and fell head over heels. Mrs Underlay grinned smugly
0x13d0  /  0x547b (0x000b)  : did a little waltz across the floor
0x13d8  /  0x5488 (0x0016)  : worked her way along the gallery, mopping the family portraits with soapy water
0x13dd  /  0x54a0 (0x0010)  : wandered off for a few seconds to tidy the manor bedrooms
0x13e2  /  0x54b2 (0x0016)  : greeted Ingrid with a grubby handshake, "You'll be OK with me, cousin"
0x13ed  /  0x54ca (0x0019)  : 
 
Jasper looked around suspiciously just to make sure he wasn't being watched by anyone
0x13f6  /  0x54e5 (0x0014)  : fumbled with the portrait and told Ingrid to go away and stop being gnosey
0x13f7  /  0x54fa (0x0022)  : stood suspiciously in front of the portrait. "Go away," he shouted at Ingrid, "You've gno business to be here"
0x13f8  /  0x551d (0x000d)  : paced up and down, waiting for Ingrid to leave
0x13f9  /  0x552b (0x0016)  : straightened the portrait and looked at Ingrid. "Have you gno work to do, girl?"
0x13fa  /  0x5542 (0x0020)  : stood by the portrait and folded his arms. "Can't you go and pester somebody else?", he said to Ingrid
0x1400  /  0x5564 (0x003c)  : said, "You can make a start by cleaning this office, but I'll fire you if I catch you looking in my desk" 
"What me, sir?," replied Ingrid trying to look innocent
0x140a  /  0x55a2 (0x0012)  : reached under his mattress and took out a copy of "Playgnome"
0x140b  /  0x55b5 (0x0020)  : 
Daisy whispered to Ingrid, "He claims he's researching the market and may go into publishing". She grinned
0x140c  /  0x55d6 (0x001d)  : took a fat cigar from the cabinet and lit it up. He puffed it contentedly as he read his magazine
0x140d  /  0x55f4 (0x0043)  : 
 
Suddenly, Jasper's cigar exploded violently, gnearly blowing his eyebrows off. "Phew! The tobacco's a bit strong in these." He spluttered. Daisy smiled secretly and patted the box of bangers in her pocket
0x140e  /  0x5639 (0x0021)  : opened up the centrefold and smiled. "If I ever marry anygnome, she's going to look like that", he said
0x1414  /  0x565c (0x0011)  : began to do press-ups by the pool and collapsed on the third one
0x1415  /  0x566e (0x001b)  : said, "Hmm, I fancy a gnice refreshing swim. I think I'll go and get changed
0x141e  /  0x568b (0x001b)  : walked over to the side of the pool, clasped his hands together and dived in feet first
0x141f  /  0x56a7 (0x0013)  : swam a width, doggy paddle and stopped, gasping for breath
0x1420  /  0x56bb (0x001d)  : climbed onto the side, lit up a cigarette and smoked it serenely as he chatted on his cordless telephone
0x1421  /  0x56d9 (0x0015)  : dropped his 'phone into the pool and had to dive down to get it back
0x1422  /  0x56ef (0x0042)  : climbed out of the pool looking like a drowned rat. He threw his soggy cigarette onto the floor and squashed it angrily underfoot. 
"That does it!", he grumbled, "I'm going to change back into my clothes"
0x1428  /  0x5734 (0x0015)  : picked up a mallet and swung it back, lining up on the croquet ball
0x1429  /  0x574a (0x0024)  : 
 
Just as Jasper was about to strike the ball, Daisy crept up behind a gnearby bush and burst a crisp bag
0x142a  /  0x576f (0x001c)  : Jasper swung through, out of control, missing the ball and taking a large chunk out of the lawn
0x143c  /  0x578d (0x0053)  : grinned broadly at Ingrid. "I'm sure you'd love to try one of my gnome-made scones," she said as he offered one of them to Ingrid. "But mind gnow, they're a bit hot". 
Ingrid took little gnotice of the cook's warning as she eyed the golden scone that she had been offered
0x143d  /  0x57e2 (0x0037)  : mixed some ingredients into a bowl and stirred them as she puffed at a cigarette. "Whoops," she said as ash fell into the bowl, "Gnever mind, it all adds to the flavour"
0x143e  /  0x581a (0x002a)  : 
 
Daisy sneezed into the cook's mixing bowl. "Sorry," she sniffed, adding, "still, it all adds to the flavour"
0x143f  /  0x5845 (0x0013)  : emptied the mixture out of the bowl and began to knead it into dough
0x1440  /  0x5859 (0x000b)  : put the dough in the oven to bake
0x1446  /  0x5866 (0x0048)  : walked out into the yard carrying a cleaver. There was an outburst of gnoise, and moments later she ran back in, chasing a bantam. 
The bantam raced around the kitchen clucking frantically, while the cook chased after it, swinging wildly with her cleaver
0x1447  /  0x58b0 (0x0021)  : chased the bantam back outside. The clucking came to a sudden end and the cook returned with the bantam tossed over her shoulder
0x1448  /  0x58d2 (0x0004)  : plucked the bantam
0x1449  /  0x58d7 (0x0023)  : gutted the bantam and threw the giblets into the stewing pot in the fireplace. "There's your supper, Daisy," she laughed
0x144a  /  0x58fb (0x0015)  : stuffed the bantam with a large orange and put it into the oven with the bread
0x1450  /  0x5912 (0x001f)  : chopped up turnips, bananas and other odds and ends, and tossed them into the stewing pot in the fireplace
0x1451  /  0x5932 (0x0038)  : 
 
Daisy had a gniff of the stew and said, "Pooh! Master won't like that stuff!" 
"He's gnot getting it," replied the cook, "It's for you"
0x1452  /  0x596b (0x000d)  : stirred the stew slowly, holding her gnose
0x1453  /  0x5979 (0x0015)  : poked the fire and sent flames curling up the sides of the stewing pot
0x145a  /  0x5990 (0x0014)  : swept the bantam feathers up from the floor and wrapped them in an old gnewspaper
0x145b  /  0x59a5 (0x000d)  : dumped a load of bantam feathers into the dustbin
0x1464  /  0x59b4 (0x0063)  : suddenly smelled something burning and dashed across the kitchen to the oven. Black smoke gushed out as she opened the door. She groped into the oven and emerged with a tray of crisp, black buns. 
 
"Ah well," said the cook, throwing the bread onto the fire, "it'll save a trip to the coal cellar"
0x1465  /  0x5a19 (0x0029)  : 
 
Daisy watched the bread burning in the fire and said to the cook, "You're right! You ought to go into the coal business"
0x1466  /  0x5a43 (0x003e)  : opened the oven and took out the bantam. "Ah, this looks luvly," she said as she, putting it on the table. "I could almost eat it all myself. In fact, I will." And she did
0x1467  /  0x5a82 (0x0013)  : finished off the bantam and washed it down with a gnice bottle of wine
0x146e  /  0x5a97 (0x0013)  : said, "G'day to you, sport! Welcome to my home"
0x146f  /  0x5aab (0x001a)  : dabbed at a painting of a vase of sunflowers. "This is my Van Gogh", he said
0x1470  /  0x5ac6 (0x0015)  : 
Daisy replied, "It looks more like the van door to me"
0x1471  /  0x5adc (0x001f)  : hummed a song about gneighbours. Ingrid felt a lump rise in her throat, but fortunately Rulf stopped in time
0x1472  /  0x5afc (0x002d)  : said, "And gnow for some modern art". He found an old bush hat, dangled its corks into a variety of paints, and shook his head vigorously
0x1473  /  0x5b2a (0x0034)  : dipped a boomerang into a pot of red paint and threw it towards the canvas. "I haven't done this for a while," he commented, "but it's coming back to me gnow"
0x1474  /  0x5b5f (0x003b)  :
