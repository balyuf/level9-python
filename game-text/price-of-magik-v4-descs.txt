0x0231  /  0x0a42 (0x0002)  : gravy
0x0259  /  0x0a46 (0x001b)  : a hefty, leather-bound tome which explains, very nicely, that you must be mad to use magik
0x025a  /  0x0a62 (0x0017)  : about eighteen inches long, with the word "DOW" etched into its beaten surface
0x025b  /  0x0a7a (0x004c)  : a see-through mineral with a specific gravity of 2.55 to 2.76, eminent cleavage, hardness 6 to 6.5, conchoidal to uneven fracture planes, very weak dispersion (0.012) and which comes in lots of pretty colours
0x025c  /  0x0ac8 (0x001c)  : a suit of delicate metal, made from overlapping silver scales. The breastplate is inscribed "FIN"
0x025d  /  0x0ae5 (0x000c)  : a magik herb with long-lasting, purplish flowers
0x025f  /  0x0af3 (0x0017)  : noisy-looking, with lots of curling brass tubes, valves, buttons and so forth
0x0260  /  0x0b0b (0x0028)  : shaped like a pyramid and bends light at a sharp angle, refracting it into rainbow colours. The word "XAM" is cut into its base
0x0261  /  0x0b34 (0x0019)  : a weird wooden cross, round and hollow, its crossbar lashed on with dried grass
0x0262  /  0x0b4e (0x0004)  : made of tallow
0x0263  /  0x0b53 (0x0023)  : a small, circular mirror with a slightly uneven edge. It reflects the features of a wild-eyed fanatic; haggard and unrecognisable
0x0264  /  0x0b77 (0x0018)  : not really crystal, more a bluish type of glass, but it is certainly spherical
0x0265  /  0x0b90 (0x0017)  : used for sweeping floors or, in the hands of council workmen, for leaning on
0x0266  /  0x0ba8 (0x0007)  : the remains of the woodpile
0x0267  /  0x0bb0 (0x0012)  : made of some dark alloy, this wheel is reinforced by powerful enchantments
0x0268  /  0x0bc3 (0x0008)  : curved, sharp and wickedly-pointed
0x0269  /  0x0bcc (0x000c)  : stamped "IBM", in large letters
0x026a  /  0x0bd9 (0x0021)  : a crude section of vine, with rough-cut ends. Just goes to prove you can't get a good staff nowadays
0x026c  /  0x0bfc (0x0009)  : made of tough, close-woven canvas
0x026d  /  0x0c06 (0x0017)  : made of some strong, flexible cloth; of a kind you have not seen before
0x026e  /  0x0c1e (0x0006)  : from a human-sized creature
0x026f  /  0x0c25 (0x0015)  : mostly about different ways to cook hobbits - and quite right too
0x0270  /  0x0c3b (0x0024)  : a bird cage, made from gilded wire in an attractive domed shape. A few fat blue feathers moulder on its bottom
0x0271  /  0x0c60 (0x000d)  : made of strong metal, with a curved end
0x0272  /  0x0c6e (0x000b)  : worth a large fortune and then some
0x0273  /  0x0c7a (0x0017)  : obviously intended for strange rituals, because symbols have been burned into each side
0x0274  /  0x0c92 (0x0040)  : from the sorting office and reads: "Following the mysterious disappearances of three postmen working in this area, we have suspended deliveries locally. Post may be collected from the sorting office. We apologise for any inconvenience"
0x0275  /  0x0cd4 (0x000c)  : about ZEN and the art of rapid progress
0x0276  /  0x0ce1 (0x0021)  : it is made from some kind of metal, possibly steel, though it looks very impure and may just be beaten iron
0x0278  /  0x0d04 (0x000b)  : set with a beautiful, solitaire diamond
0x0279  /  0x0d10 (0x001b)  : made of fine, heavy cloth, in a rich shade of red, with golden buttons and clasps
0x027a  /  0x0d2c (0x001d)  : sodium chloride. Not to be confused with sodium hydroxide, or sodium carbonate, or sodium amytal..
0x027b  /  0x0d4a (0x005c)  : part of an ancient magik training manual. It is old and faded, but you can just make out: '...To use a spell, hold the... ..Nd "CAST spell", "CAST spell AT target" or "CAST spell ---- direction)", then ta...'
0x027c  /  0x0da8 (0x0008)  : battered, but still serviceable
0x027d  /  0x0db1 (0x000c)  : decorated across the forehead with black stars
0x027e  /  0x0dbe (0x0024)  : a weird kind of ornament, with all sorts of crawly things wriggling around on its surface - done in bas-relief, of course
0x028a  /  0x0de4 (0x0007)  : sharp and made of bronze
0x028b  /  0x0dec (0x0016)  : hefty, with a sharp blade whose side is inscribed: "Bat's Bane"
0x028c  /  0x0e03 (0x001f)  : its blade is slightly chipped and inscribed: "rubilacxe", the letters being traced in faded gold leaf
0x028d  /  0x0e23 (0x0015)  : a huge sword, one-handed and two-edged, the longsword of old, the claidheamh
0x028e  /  0x0e39 (0x0010)  : a narrow, sharply pointed knife, favoured by assassins
0x0291  /  0x0e4b (0x0029)  : a chubby little statuette with ripples of blubber and slobbery cheeks, cavorting like a baby elephant among a veritable jungle of vine leaves and grapes
0x0292  /  0x0e75 (0x0043)  : 658;a huge stone representation of Myglar. It has tentacles instead of hands, and a monstrous face whose eyesockets burn darkly beneath a stone cowl. It is hard to tell whether this is a work of fancy or what Myglar really looks like
0x0293  /  0x0eba (0x0010)  : a hideous winged monster with bulbous eyes and lolling tongue
0x0294  /  0x0ecb (0x0028)  : a tall image of Myglar, with tentacles for arms. A vandal has scrawled "SPY" on its left foot in fluorescent green crayon
0x0295  /  0x0ef4 (0x007f)  : a huge creature, similar in shape to R*b*rt M*xw*ll, but 15 feet longer and with fewer chins. It spends a lot of its time sulking in corners because nobody loves it, and sucks most of its meals alone in the mortuary. Which isn't to say that it would terribly receptive to just any old body who wandered up and said, "Watford!". It's far too bad-tempered for that
0x0296  /  0x0f76 (0x0029)  : an unpleasant-looking, stooped old man. He notices your gaze and snarls: "Stop gawping, monkey-features!" In a cracked and raucous voice
0x0297  /  0x0fa0 (0x0009)  : a perfect replica of a monkey
0x0298  /  0x0faa (0x0034)  : a hideous monster whose bug-eyes glow with a pale light, wobbling slowly at the ends of their long stalks... (It could make a packet playing bit-parts in horror movies)
0x0299  /  0x0fdf (0x0035)  : an ancient wizard, who has indeed got tentacles instead of arms. His eyes glow with a terrible light, and his bones creak as he shuffles towards you, muttering in an evil monotone
0x029a  /  0x1015 (0x0071)  : a mass of hairy legs and with a bloated body. Its pincers clack in anticipation. I should look out if I were you - it's pretty narked because it was almost included in a very successful television documentary, but was rejected at the last minute in favour of something even nastier, less cowardly and with a more interesting sex life. It has been out to get Mankind ever since
0x029b  /  0x1088 (0x003f)  : slimy and horribly big, its body filling the tunnel and slithering towards you like toothpaste through a tube, a movement it perfected for its role in "The Martian Invaders Return! Again! (Part XII)"
0x029c  /  0x10c9 (0x0024)  : small, ugly and extremely short-sighted. It works part-time for you-know-who, dubbing all those little squeaks and whistles onto the line
0x029d  /  0x10ee (0x0049)  : very hairy - even its hairs have hairs - and its red mouth is open in a snarl, exposing an awful lot of teeth: the pose that won it its famous role in "I Was a Teenage Vampire's Werewolf's Mother (Part III)"
0x029e  /  0x1139 (0x003d)  : there are a lot of them, scuttling over the stone columns and covering the floor in a living, seething, blanket. (Didn't they do a film with J**n C*ll*ns recently?...)
0x029f  /  0x1177 (0x0054)  : terrible, born of a dark mother in the depths of the Earth, amidst horrors beyond the ken of Man. How can it be described? - for none who have seen it have returned, or, returning, are stark mad, and can do no more than babble about fears unnameable and unnamed
0x02a0  /  0x11cd (0x00c6)  : licking its lips, its shrivelled skin pulled surgically tight over its bones, its eyes narrowed dangerously. It is wearing an expression intended to initiate a certain train of thought in anybody who sees it, which should run something like this: "That poor ghoul has never quite got over its rejection from that role in "Skeleton! (Part V)". Dear oh dear. I wonder if its deeply-felt sense of ambition thwarted has anything to do with the discovery of the half-eaten body of Richmond Hogsbody, erstwhile director of the said movie in Lower Wallop graveyard? Could that debonair exterior really hide a ravening bloodlust and desire for revenge? Oh my goodness"
0x02a1  /  0x1297 (0x004c)  : grins cheerfully, revealing a fortune in gold fillings. It has just passed a screen test for the leading role in "The Robots are Coming! (Part IX)", and hasn't killed anyone for at least three days. It looks very uncomfortable in armour
0x02a2  /  0x12e5 (0x0044)  : wrapped in grimy bandages that bind the ancient cerecloths to its desiccated frame. It has absolutely no ambition, and has spent most of its death right here, enjoying the peace and quiet. It tends to get most dischuffed if it's disturbed
0x02a3  /  0x132b (0x002e)  : see-through - rather like Louis Hayward in the 1939 version of "The Man in the Iron Mask", which, of course, has absolutely nothing to do with anything
0x02a4  /  0x135a (0x0029)  : it's very bony, and not quite right about the rib-cage, owing to its having been assembled by a group of first-year necromancy students on an off day
0x02a6  /  0x1385 (0x001d)  : a see-through spirit, 70% proof. Against weapons, magik, that sort of thing, that is
0x02a7  /  0x13a3 (0x004b)  : a fearsome graveyard spirit, a living fog that expands to fill the room, its misty body pulsating with loathsome lights. You don't need to know any more, do you - everybody's seen "The Devouring Fog (Part II)" haven't they?
0x02a8  /  0x13f0 (0x0097)  : an animated corpse who started life in an obscure graveyard in Haiti and went on to star in such gems of the silver screen as "Night of the Living Dead" and "I Walked with a Teenage Zombi Vampire's Mummy". Unfortunately, he lost his credibility when his arm fell off, so now he haunts the nearest thing to a pyramid he could find, in memory of his truly stunning performance in "The Egyptian Zombies are Coming! (Part VII) (Episode 3) (reel 2)"
0x02ad  /  0x148b (0x0020)  : a vile weed, shaped like a man daubed by a maniacal toddler and used in many nefarious necromantic dabblings
0x02ae  /  0x14ac (0x0017)  : a magical plant which is rumoured to miraculously improve vision when rubbed into the eyes
0x02af  /  0x14c4 (0x000d)  : perhaps useful, but there again, perhaps not
0x02b0  /  0x14d2 (0x0008)  : made of a very hard material
0x02b1  /  0x14db (0x0035)  : a special tool used for trench-digging by grave diggers (tho' why grave diggers should be digging trenches when they should be digging graves is a mystery to all concerned)
0x02b2  /  0x1511 (0x000e)  : very lifelike. You can almost hear its fins flapping
0x02b6  /  0x1521 (0x0004)  : quite deep
0x02b7  /  0x1526 (0x0010)  : a small lump of rock, dwarfed by a stone moon
0x02b8  /  0x1537 (0x0023)  : an impressive edifice, but you know how it is: when you've seen one perspex altar, you've seen them all..
0x02b9  /  0x155b (0x0014)  : a rowing boat, painted bright blue with staring eyes on the prow
0x02ba  /  0x1570 (0x0010)  : cast from several tonnes of bronze and covered with bat-droppings
0x02bb  /  0x1581 (0x0017)  : a matched set of nine, made of dense oak and bound with metal ribs
0x02bc  /  0x1599 (0x0009)  : an antique - and it's ticking
0x02bd  /  0x15a3 (0x000f)  : of green velvet, and covering the whole west wall
0x02be  /  0x15b3 (0x0022)  : it is a sturdy oak desk, with a battered leather top stained with black ink and some other, reddish stuff
0x02c0  /  0x15d7 (0x0019)  : a beautiful expanse of sparkling water that shines a tranquil blue under the watery sky
0x02c1  /  0x15f1 (0x000b)  : a small rod mounted in the floor
0x02c4  /  0x15fe (0x0008)  : carved all over with tiny hieroglyphs
0x02c5  /  0x1607 (0x0015)  : marked with the word "SAN", its letters rippling gently in the current
0x02c6  /  0x161d (0x0017)  : completely covering the south wall, giving a very clear view of your every move
0x02c7  /  0x1635 (0x002e)  : somewhat obscure: 
"My father is dark, 
My mother's unknown. 
I dwell in high places, 
and where the ghosts moan"
0x02c8  /  0x1664 (0x0017)  : made of strong hessian dampened by the misty air, and slightly slippery to the touch
0x02c9  /  0x167c (0x002b)  : larger than of yore, it has grown to some 7 feet across, and glows brightly, shedding a red light that streams from the alcove into the chapel beyond
0x02ca  /  0x16a8 (0x001b)  : shaped like a coffin, its mighty stone sides are carved with ancient scribblings, like those on the pillars
0x02cb  /  0x16c4 (0x0011)  : it is very sharp and sticks up through a hole in the floor
0x02cc  /  0x16d6 (0x0042)  : it has been sorely misused over the years, and is covered with gouges hacked in it by the over-enthusiastic wielding of a meat cleaver. There are several sets of initials as well, and the word "MAD" carved in chunky, rough-cut letters
0x02cd  /  0x171a (0x000f)  : it is made of elegantly carved mahogany, with mother-of-pearl inlays
0x02ce  /  0x172a (0x0010)  : it's sticky, in much the same way that water isn't
0x02cf  /  0x173b (0x000f)  : it slimes desperately across the floor, chittering with terror
0x02d0  /  0x174b (0x000c)  : neatly stacked, all ready for a fire
0x02d1  /  0x1758 (0x0008)  : stuck firmly in the ceiling
0x02d2  /  0x1761 (0x001b)  : a strong vine with a good, straight trunk, clinging tenaciously to the side of the house
0x02d3  /  0x177d (0x001e)  : a model which re-enacts, through endless repetitions, the massacre in the council chamber which brought Myglar to power
0x02d4  /  0x179c (0x0017)  : a picture of a scrawny female healer, plying her wares in a crowded market-place
0x02d5  /  0x17b4 (0x0015)  : grey and flaky, and looks as if had been lying here a long time
0x02d6  /  0x17ca (0x000b)  : about 10 tonnes, I would say
0x02d9  /  0x17d7 (0x0024)  : of Stonehenge, cut off from the people by blood-stained razor-wire. A column of fake Druids parades solemnly between the massive stones
0x02da  /  0x17fc (0x0018)  : of a hellish dark spawn, clawing its way through the black places beneath the earth
0x02db  /  0x1815 (0x0024)  : of foul beasts howling at the moon. They are incredibly ugly and their pallid eyes dangle at the ends of long, wavering stalks
0x02dc  /  0x183a (0x0012)  : of a ghoul feasting happily on the remains of an earlier adventurer
0x02dd  /  0x184d (0x000c)  : of a posse of werewolves chasing their victim
0x02de  /  0x185a (0x0022)  : of an evil-looking man with tentacles in place of arms, gloating over the red moon crystal as he sucks at its power
0x02e0  /  0x187e (0x0008)  : a fine specimen of humanity
0x02e1  /  0x1887 (0x0007)  : much like a small trout
0x02e2  /  0x188f (0x0023)  : a magnificent oak door with embossed knobs on every panel. The word "ESP" is moulded roughly into the brass knocker
0x02e3  /  0x18b3 (0x0012)  : like a hawk's. Not a single thing escapes your piercing gaze
0x02e4  /  0x18c6 (0x0008)  : made of beautifully carved wood
0x02e5  /  0x18cf (0x0007)  : an ordinary wooden door
0x03e9  /  0x18da (0x0007)  : a dark and winding drive
0x03ea  /  0x18e2 (0x0005)  : a rickety woodshed
0x03eb  /  0x18e8 (0x0005)  : a herb garden
0x03ec  /  0x18ee (0x0005)  : a roof garden
0x03ed  /  0x18f4 (0x0003)  : a vine
0x03ee  /  0x18f8 (0x0003)  : a vine
0x03ef  /  0x18fc (0x0007)  : the top of the vine
0x03f0  /  0x1904 (0x0005)  : a sloping roof
0x03f1  /  0x190a (0x0003)  : a roof
0x03fa  /  0x190f (0x0005)  : a grassy plain
0x03fb  /  0x1915 (0x0005)  : a grassy plain
0x03fc  /  0x191b (0x0003)  : some steps
0x03fd  /  0x191f (0x0003)  : some steps
0x03fe  /  0x1923 (0x0003)  : some steps
0x03ff  /  0x1927 (0x0003)  : some steps
0x0400  /  0x192b (0x0003)  : some steps
0x0402  /  0x1930 (0x0007)  : a strange rock formation
0x0403  /  0x1938 (0x0005)  : a grassy plain
0x0404  /  0x193e (0x0007)  : a volcanic rock outcrop
0x0405  /  0x1946 (0x000a)  : a grassy plain beside a pillar
0x0406  /  0x1951 (0x0007)  : a sullen standing stone
0x0407  /  0x1959 (0x0007)  : a sullen standing stone
0x0408  /  0x1961 (0x0007)  : a sullen standing stone
0x0409  /  0x1969 (0x0007)  : a sullen standing stone
0x040a  /  0x1971 (0x0007)  : a sullen standing stone
0x040b  /  0x1979 (0x0007)  : a sullen standing stone
0x040c  /  0x1981 (0x0007)  : a sullen standing stone
0x040d  /  0x1989 (0x0004)  : a cold pillar
0x040e  /  0x198e (0x0004)  : a cold pillar

0x0515  /  0x1d57 (0x0070)  :  just to the south of a house, whose venerable magnificence has decayed through years of abandonment and neglect. It stands, desolate and hollow-windowed, a malevolent shadow of its former self. Gnarled creepers cling desperately to the walls, almost completely enveloping the building. A huge carved door with a blackened brass knocker in the shape of a griffin's head is set in the middle of the sprawling facade
0x0516  /  0x1dc9 (0x0042)  :  which is slowly sinking into the dank marsh that has grown up and engulfed the grounds of the house. Its timbers are rotting - livid patches of mold and rank orange fungus dot its sides - and the air is redolent with decay
0x0517  /  0x1e0d (0x0046)  :  on an insect-infested mound which rises through the marsh mist. A few stunted plants survive miserably among the stark, skeletal remains of their fellows. Droplets of water gather sadly on their leaves, before dripping quietly onto the cold ground below
0x0518  /  0x1e55 (0x0044)  : , cold and silent, hemmed in by grey stone and made dark and wet by the dank mist. A few bright herbs cling to life; lonely survivors from the time when the sun still shone and caring hands tended the garden
0x0519  /  0x1e9b (0x0040)  :  whose strong, gnarled branches have intertwined, clutching at each others' throats and digging their short, dry roots into the stone walls. Their cankered bark is cracked and seamed; covered with slippery grey lichen
0x051a  /  0x1edd (0x000e)  : , pushing through a tangled mass of decaying tendrils
0x051b  /  0x1eec (0x0014)  :  which clings precariously to the crumbling wall at the house roof's edge
0x051c  /  0x1f01 (0x001d)  : , in weak, watery sunlight that filters uneasily through the mist, glinting on the slick grey slates
0x051d  /  0x1f1f (0x0035)  : , high above the dismal marshes and mist-covered plain. Black skeletons of trees rise up through the grey blanket of mist that obscures the grounds of the house, to gleam in the half-light
0x0526  /  0x1f56 (0x0009)  : , mist-covered and stretching into obscurity
0x0527  /  0x1f60 (0x0011)  : , where the dew hangs like jewels and cold mist gathers
0x0528  /  0x1f72 (0x000c)  :  leading around and up to a Gothic portico
0x0529  /  0x1f7f (0x000b)  : , in the middle of the great staircase
0x052a  /  0x1f8b (0x002b)  : , that are part of a single stone staircase, from which two further staircases rise in flights around a central square, to rejoin at a Gothic portico
0x052b  /  0x1fb7 (0x0012)  : , part of the great staircase that leads to an ancient portico
0x052c  /  0x1fca (0x000c)  :  leading around and up to a Gothic portico
0x052e  /  0x1fd8 (0x0047)  :  which juts out from the plain in a tumble of hard, grey stone. Its surface is bare of any weed, and slick with moisture from the damp, misty air which hangs heavily around it, deadening all sound save the sullen drip of falling water
0x052f  /  0x2021 (0x0017)  :  where the mist curls damply around your feet and face, chilling you to the bone
0x0530  /  0x2039 (0x000e)  : , sharp beneath your feet and twisted into tortuous shapes
0x0531  /  0x2048 (0x0017)  : , and the mist closes in around you, muffling sight and sound beneath an icy blanket
0x0532  /  0x2060 (0x0008)  : . Water runs sadly down its sides
0x0533  /  0x2069 (0x0008)  : . Water runs sadly down its sides
0x0534  /  0x2072 (0x0008)  : . Water runs sadly down its sides

0x0538  /  0x2096 (0x0008)  : . Water runs sadly down its sides
0x0539  /  0x209f (0x0009)  : , grey stone looming against the mist
0x053a  /  0x20a9 (0x0009)  : , grey stone looming against the mist
0x053b  /  0x20b3 (0x0009)  : , grey stone looming amid the mist
0x053c  /  0x20bd (0x0009)  : , grey stone looming amid the mist
0x053d  /  0x20c7 (0x0009)  : , grey stone looming amid the mist
0x053e  /  0x20d1 (0x000a)  : , hewn from hard, grey granite
0x0540  /  0x20dd (0x003a)  : , where fog swirls ominously: curling around the black, dead branches of drowned trees which rise like a long-forgotten nightmare from the still waters. A cold, wordless cry echoes lonely from the hidden distance
0x0541  /  0x2118 (0x0037)  :  which roils between the walls of a deep chasm, its waters swift and turbid. It lashes at the boulders upon its dismal shores with a booming roar, echoing and re-echoing through endless tunnels
0x0542  /  0x2150 (0x001d)  :  which glistens viscidly against the yellow mud. The air trembles with the far-off boom of rushing waters
0x0543  /  0x216e (0x001d)  :  where green gunge oozes from the walls and ceiling, glurping onto the floor to collect in thick puddles
0x0544  /  0x218c (0x0016)  :  where the walls run with water and the muddy floor exudes a noisome odor
0x0545  /  0x21a3 (0x001d)  : . The water bubbles past, cool against your sides, while strange creaks and groanings sound from the depths
0x0546  /  0x21c1 (0x0022)  : , flowing from darkness into darkness. It laps against the gloomy shore, sussurating gently like a still sea at midnight
0x0547  /  0x21e4 (0x0011)  : , which echoes hollow beneath your feet, its timbers creaking slightly
0x0548  /  0x21f6 (0x0015)  : , which reaches out into the rushing water, quivering to the rhythm of the waves
0x0549  /  0x220c (0x0005)  : , cold and damp
0x054a  /  0x2212 (0x000d)  :  whose chilly air carries a hint of rottenness
0x054b  /  0x2220 (0x0017)  : , listening to the sound of rushing waters flowing in the darkness of the cave beyond
0x054c  /  0x2238 (0x0031)  : , where the air trembles with the far-off boom of rushing waters. Yet the room itself is dry and warm, and a pleasant smell of old polish and metal-cleaner hangs in the air
0x054d  /  0x226a (0x0033)  : . The atmosphere is heavy, weighing down upon you, as though the air were charged with mystic power. A low humming begins at the back of your skull, more felt than heard
0x054e  /  0x229e (0x0021)  : . The walls shimmer with an ethereal light, paler than the gleam of metal, soft as the petals of a china flower
0x054f  /  0x22c0 (0x0006)  : . Aaaaaagh!!!
0x0550  /  0x22c7 (0x0038)  :  which twists and turns aimlessly, and seemingly without any pattern. The walls are made from smooth rock, their curves so subtle that they must have been the work of masons of the far distant past
0x0551  /  0x2300 (0x00a6)  :  which show desolate, red-rocked landscapes, or bowls of fruit and dead fowl, their paint marred by a network of fine cracks where the surface has aged and dried. Some are of people: men, women and children, all of whom have the same aquiline nose and pointed jawline. Many of them have eyes of the same curious shade of green. 
 
One, a woman, is depicted with her yellow hair flying out behind her, her robes whipped around her slender form by the wind. Her green eyes are narrowed and fire flies from her outstretched hands
0x0552  /  0x23a9 (0x002c)  : , a long, low room, panelled with wood, glowing gold like sleepy afternoon sunlight. The room is completely empty and smells faintly of dust and beeswax
0x0555  /  0x23d7 (0x0008)  :  now fallen into disrepair
0x0556  /  0x23e0 (0x001d)  : , where strange lights glint and sparkle, teasing the eye, and phantom voices whisper in your ears
0x0557  /  0x23fe (0x0057)  :  in a small courtyard paved with stone. Forbidding grey walls tower up on every side, almost obscuring the sky far above, and gargoyles leer down upon you, their stone eyes staring. A few sad weeds grow in the cracks between the stones and the gallows loom, huge and silent, over all
0x0558  /  0x2457 (0x002d)  : , its walls hung with red velvet, with strange signs painted upon the floor. A low humming fills the air, almost beyond the range of human hearing
0x0559  /  0x2485 (0x004d)  : ; a peaceful room, sparsely furnished. It has panelled walls of simple dark wood and a colourful rug upon the highly polished floor. A simple table and chair stand in one corner, and in the centre of the room there is a prie-dieu with a blue velvet kneeler
0x055a  /  0x24d4 (0x0034)  : , wood-panelled, like the sanctum, but unkempt and neglected. Dust lies in the corners, and the small altar is untended. A reddish-brown stain marks the floor in front of the altar
0x055b  /  0x2509 (0x002f)  : , its cold stone walls and vaulted roof hung with dusty cobwebs. The air smells mouldy, and mushrooms sprout from the packed-earth floor, glowing with a pale light
0x055c  /  0x2539 (0x0032)  : . The walls are pocked with tiny alcoves, each holding a neat pile of bones with a skull set neatly on top. Other bones lie scattered haphazardly on the floor
0x055d  /  0x256c (0x001e)  : , its arched entrance engraved with indecipherable runes. From a brass curtain-rod, hang rich, blue-velvet drapes
0x055e  /  0x258b (0x003b)  :  filled with glowing red light, its walls carved with scenes from the life of Zog. Wooden pews face the alcove to the north, and a bunch of dead flowers lies in a dusty heap in one corner
0x055f  /  0x25c7 (0x0014)  : , its metal walls, floor and ceiling polished to a mirror finish
0x0560  /  0x25dc (0x0015)  : , carved into foul and wicked shapes, a grotesque monument to inhuman ingenuity
0x0561  /  0x25f2 (0x002f)  :  whose atmosphere of brooding gloom oppresses the spirit and dulls the mind. In stark contrast, the word "FLY" is picked out in a bright mural on the floor
0x0562  /  0x2622 (0x0037)  : , its walls mottled with febrile green-and-black striations. Mighty pillars support the roof, engraved with complicated hieroglyphics and painted in raw, earthen colours. Huge cobwebs hang down in gossamer curtains
0x0563  /  0x265a (0x0038)  : ; a great mausoleum, buried beneath the earth. Mouldering coffins rest on carved stone benches around the room, their timbers rotting. The lid of one has shattered, leaving its grisly contents exposed
0x0564  /  0x2693 (0x0014)  : , in pristine condition, its white walls and surfaces gleaming in the cold air
0x0565  /  0x26a8 (0x002a)  : , justly named, for a single mighty cobweb stretches across it, woven from strands as thick as spun steel and suspended from stalactite to stalagmite
0x0566  /  0x26d3 (0x0036)  :  made of some transparent substance, warm like perspex but far harder, and filled with colours that no glass could capture. Wind chimes hang from the ceiling, tinkling melodically like children's voices
0x0567  /  0x270a (0x002b)  :  that looks out onto a grassy plain; mist-covered and mysterious. A strange cone of yellow light surrounds it, through which phantom shapes come and go
0x0568  /  0x2736 (0x0028)  : , and the air is cold and crisp, freezing your breath as it emerges. Hoar frost crunches beneath your feet, and the walls sparkle as though bejewelled
0x0569  /  0x275f (0x0022)  : , where crystal light shines from a central unseen source, clear through the eerie darkness which seems to crouch in the corners
0x056a  /  0x2782 (0x001a)  :  to the north of the attic, where the air is musty, and smells of pigeons and mothballs
0x056b  /  0x279d (0x0020)  : . Across from you and to one side lies the dismal roof garden, and above you a tower ascends into darkness
0x056c  /  0x27be (0x0010)  : , cold and dark, and festooned with sticky, clinging cobwebs
0x0588  /  0x27d0 (0x001b)  :  above a staircase spiralling down into the gloom, its rungs ornamented with lattice-work and bronze foliage
0x0589  /  0x27ec (0x0008)  : , bare boards beneath your feet
0x058a  /  0x27f5 (0x0083)  :  filled with the accumulated junk of centuries. Here, old books, broken artefacts and cracked pottery vies with a tumble of moth-eaten clothes and trunks, stuffed to overflowing with the fashions of a bygone age. Mice scuttle among the boxes, their small feet clicking on the floorboards, and somewhere a rat gnaws frantically. Pallid light slinks through a dormer window to the north, lighting the dancing dust motes and laying a sickly patina over all it touches
0x058b  /  0x287b (0x0021)  :  with a sloping ceiling that droops despondently towards the floor, its rafters humped and shapeless beneath the wreckage of ages
0x058c  /  0x289d (0x0013)  : , less than a metre deep, which was hidden behind the mirror
0x058d  /  0x28b1 (0x001d)  : , festooned with grimy cobwebs that cover the few pieces of furniture, giving everything a slumped appearance
0x058e  /  0x28cf (0x0049)  :  where mist curls sleepily through the slatted shutters, chilling the air, and where rotting floorboards creak and moan beneath your feet. Stray shafts of light quiver through the gloom, crawling down dusty beams and rafters and slithering over the piles of dust that lie everywhere
0x058f  /  0x291a (0x005f)  : , its vaulted ceiling supported by graceful columns that seem at first glance to be marred by ugly brown stains, but which, on closer inspection, prove to be wooden pillars covered with peeling paper that has been painted to simulate marble. The walls, too, are paper-covered, their crimson and green mottlings hiding rough granite blocks
0x0590  /  0x297b (0x003d)  : . The walls are hung with faded pictures, some done in oils, some in watercolour, some in gouache, yet all depict war, and the horrors of war. Wherever you look, cannons flare and swords flash
0x0591  /  0x29b9 (0x0014)  : , sunk in gloom, its faded carpet and hangings dank and fusty
0x0592  /  0x29ce (0x0019)  : , its high walls cloth-covered, the statuettes and vases on its delicate shelves dusty and forgotten
0x0593  /  0x29e8 (0x0056)  : , its cold stone steps hollowed by long usage, and with odd symbols and obscure grinning faces carved into the walls. Every now and then a small, slitted window lets light in, but the walls are too thick, and the windows too high for you to see anything but the dismal grey sky through them
0x0594  /  0x2a40 (0x001a)  : , its cast-iron rungs clattering beneath your feet, the banister smooth and cold under your grasping hand
0x0596  /  0x2a5c (0x001d)  : , still dry and cool, its contents well-preserved, though all around it has fallen into neglect and ruin
0x0597  /  0x2a7a (0x007c)  : , an extraordinary place, done up to look like the bridge of a ship. The walls are panelled with varnished teak, and the same wood covers the ceiling and floor. A table juts out from one wall, bearing a huge sheet of glass under which complicated charts are displayed. All the fittings are of brass, and a ship's wheel stands between the table and a small galley, whose stove has been lovingly black-leaded. Leather-covered benches line the walls
0x0598  /  0x2af8 (0x0022)  : , its walls lighter than pine, yet turning a mellow gold with age. They still smell faintly of scented wood
0x0599  /  0x2b1b (0x0024)  : , fairly small and piled high with junk. Old tools lie haphazardly on the floor, along with a jumble of dismantled furniture
0x059a  /  0x2b40 (0x001b)  : , the smell of decaying wood strong in the stagnant air. Its ancient panels sound strangely hollow
0x059b  /  0x2b5c (0x001e)  :  with one oaken wall and three of sad grey stone. An atmosphere of foreboding hangs over the place
0x059c  /  0x2b7b (0x0038)  : . Torches line the walls, seemingly burning for ever without consuming any fuel, their light flickering with an eerie green lustre. Fluted pilasters reach up to a row of pointed cupolas above
0x059d  /  0x2bb4 (0x005b)  : . The heavy wooden counters are strewn with bizarre apparatus: glass bottles and tubes of every shape imaginable, strangely-coloured fluids, and sinister metal instruments litter every available surface. There is a strong chemical smell, and one wall is blackened, as though by an explosion. The word "SEE" has been scratched in the soot
0x059e  /  0x2c11 (0x0026)  : . The great metal skylight in the ceiling is jammed half-way shut, allowing the dismal light from outside to slink miserably around the room
0x059f  /  0x2c38 (0x0029)  :  where little trickles of dust and stones continually shower from ceiling, and every slightest sound sets off an ominous rumbling behind the cracked stone walls
0x05a0  /  0x2c62 (0x0013)  : , its ceiling bulging towards the ground, its walls bowing outwards
0x05a1  /  0x2c76 (0x006c)  : . Padded leather couches are pushed against the walls, interspersed with saggy chintz-covered armchairs. A small table holds a jigsaw picturing a moonlit graveyard, complete except for one last piece, which, as with all jigsaws, is missing. A painting on the wall shows a family of ghouls feasting in a dungeon crypt, and a small brass plaque beneath reads "His Fifteenth Birthday"
0x05a2  /  0x2ce4 (0x000f)  : , every wall lined with books, from floor to ceiling
0x05a3  /  0x2cf4 (0x0010)  :  and the musty smell of old books chokes the air
0x05a4  /  0x2d05 (0x0008)  : , surrounded by dark shadows
0x05a5  /  0x2d0e (0x0057)  : . The bare oak walls are warped and split. In one corner, a pile of bones lies huddled amid the tattered remnants of a monk's habit and cowl, and the broken shards of a sword gleam dully. On the wall above, the word "DET" is scrawled in dark, dried fluid
0x05a6  /  0x2d67 (0x0020)  :  where an icy wind blows from nowhere into nowhere, wailing like a lost soul in the empty midnight hours
0x05a7  /  0x2d88 (0x0033)  : . The walls are covered with stamped bronze panels, their delicate traceries of spring flowers and newly-opened leaves picked out in gold and silver, with precious gems glinting in their hearts
0x05a8  /  0x2dbc (0x0033)  :  to the east of the painting gallery. It is a small space, hung with long velvet curtains in a comfortable shade of wine red. A stone staircase rises up through its ceiling
0x05a9  /  0x2df0 (0x003f)  : , hacked from the damp earth, and shored up with blackened timbers. Roots trail down from the ceiling, their tendrils groping for moisture in the empty air, and wriggling bundles of pale, eyeless worms squirm upon the floor
0x05aa  /  0x2e31 (0x0041)  : , where the air is dry and the earthen walls are sealed with a rough coating of yellow clay. A cool breeze stirs the air, and from far, far away, a faint rumbling boom echoes with the sound of running water
0x05ab  /  0x2e74 (0x004a)  :  where every plane runs where it will, with a total disregard for correct interspacial relationships. The angles where they join are insane, eye-wrenching collisions between walls and floors, walls and ceilings, ceilings and floors - that defy comprehension and leave the observer's mind reeling
0x05ac  /  0x2ec0 (0x0050)  :  that grope blindly from walls, floor and ceiling, wrapping round anything they touch, their suckers reaching out for living flesh. Fortunately, they cannot reach more than half a metre into the room, and those on the floor have been pruned so that they can do little but waggle their stumps
0x05ad  /  0x2f12 (0x000c)  : . Great jars and bottles line the walls
0x05ae  /  0x2f1f (0x0057)  :  panelled in mellow golden wood. Elegant wooden chairs stand against the far wall, and an inlaid table in the centre of the room holds a beautiful vase filled with dead flowers. Ornamental candelabra stand on small shelves at regular intervals along the walls. All the windows are firmly closed and shuttered
0x05af  /  0x2f78 (0x001d)  : , almost completely filled by a huge, leather-and-wood porter's chair, which commands a view of every exit
0x05b0  /  0x2f96 (0x001c)  :  of the ruined mansion; an imposing vestibule with a front door hewn from mighty oak planks
0x05b2  /  0x2fb4 (0x002e)  : , its beautiful yellow wood pockmarked with thousands of little holes. Where a small piece of wood has fallen away, you can see a heaving mass of tiny beetles
0x05b3  /  0x2fe3 (0x001f)  : , very cramped, and with cuphooks sticking into your back. Wooden shelves cover every wall except that which holds the door
0x05b4  /  0x3003 (0x0056)  :  with walls intricately carved from elm wood. Most depict the pastoral life of some vaguely medieval era, and chubby peasants sport amid the summer hedges, rampant with sukebind. One of them shows an old man driving four cows to the milking, with but ten legs and one-and-a-half horns between them
0x05b5  /  0x305b (0x001f)  : , carved from the living rock, its edges still jagged and raw. Stones and other debris litter the floor
0x05b6  /  0x307b (0x002c)  : , though quite how you know this is hard to tell. It looks pretty much like any other wood-panelled passage and smells of stale, over-cooked cabbage
0x05b7  /  0x30a8 (0x0025)  : , an octagonal room with a low, uneven ceiling. Splintered boxes litter the floor, their lids ripped off and the contents vanished
0x05b8  /  0x30ce (0x005d)  :  where hundreds upon hundreds of tins of sardines are kept, all unopened. Some litter the floor around an old anvil, their sides dented as though someone had been hitting them repeatedly. Others have evidently been gnawed, and are full of teethmarks. In one corner lies a pile of tin openers, all bent and rusty and all broken
0x05b9  /  0x312d (0x000c)  : , down which trickles a little stream of mud
0x05ba  /  0x313a (0x0026)  :  with a large, circular table in its middle. Ancient weapons are hung upon the walls, and a great fireplace stands empty and cold
0x05bb  /  0x3161 (0x002c)  :  hung with royal blue velvet curtains. A curious globe shines with a milky light, illuminating the silver traceries and arcane figures described upon the floor
0x05bc  /  0x318e (0x0026)  :  that looks like the inside of a three-sided pyramid. A triangular chandelier made of dull grey metal hangs down from the apex of the roof
0x05bd  /  0x31b5 (0x0051)  : : a rather pokey room in which are kept all kinds of stationery. Sheets of rich, creamy parchment are piled next to reams of yellowing paper. Quills, ink, chalks, charcoal, painting materials and books of gold and silver leaf are neatly contained in wooden pigeon-holes
0x05be  /  0x3208 (0x003e)  :  which once housed bales of cloth and sheets of fine leather. Silks, velvets, furs, needles and pins: all have now rotted or rusted away, and their remains are a playground for mice and running spiders
0x05bf  /  0x3247 (0x002b)  : . Every surface is lacquered a different shade of red, and any patterns are done in black, so that the effect is hot, dry, and thirsty
0x05c0  /  0x3273 (0x0034)  : . Artificial grass sprouts from every available surface, and silk flowers nod in a fan-assisted breeze. A broken pipe,running through the ceiling, presents a fair approximation of rain
0x05c1  /  0x32a8 (0x0029)  :  made of rickety wood, that climb through a narrow stone shaft from darkness into darkness. The sound of running water booms faintly in the distance
0x05c2  /  0x32d2 (0x0035)  :  whose floor and ceiling curve towards each other until they meet in an uneven point at the southern end. Here loose stones have tumbled from the roof, to lie scattered on the floor
0x05c3  /  0x3308 (0x0020)  : , its floor some inches below the thresholds leading into it, trapping ankle-high, sludgy-black water. It smells of fish
0x05c4  /  0x3329 (0x0021)  : . Censers hang from the walls, giving forth a thick, cloying smoke whose sweetness cannot hide their underlying fetidity
0x05c5  /  0x334b (0x0009)  :  with whitewashed walls and polished floor
0x05c6  /  0x3355 (0x0023)  :  or perverted vestry. Dull purple and black robes hang from hooks along one wall, and diabolical instruments from another
0x05c7  /  0x3379 (0x000c)  :  filled with bales of straw and reeds
0x05c8  /  0x3386 (0x002c)  : . Ham bones hang from the ceiling, the flesh long since stripped from them by enterprising mice and ants, and the shelves are bare of all save stains
0x05c9  /  0x33b3 (0x0019)  : . Water drips monotonously from the ceiling, and meanders down the walls in sad little trickles
0x05ca  /  0x33cd (0x0015)  : , whose freezing air catches in your throat and numbs your nose and ears
0x05cb  /  0x33e3 (0x003b)  : , a nasty place that at some time has been used as a stillroom. Several green bottles rest on a low partition, and lie scattered around a complicated distillation apparatus. Shards of glass litter the floor
0x05cc  /  0x341f (0x0014)  : : scarcely a corridor at all - more a store room with exits
0x05cd  /  0x3434 (0x0017)  :  with a repeating pattern of dinky milk jugs, apples, and dead peasants
0x05ce  /  0x344c (0x0005)  : , squeezing tightly
0x05cf  /  0x3452 (0x0012)  :  that backs onto nothing, and leads out into a mist-shrouded plain
0x05d0  /  0x3465 (0x0029)  : . Where the light falls, you can see the fossilized remains of giant snails, and other, even less attractive, creatures, embedded in the walls
0x05d1  /  0x348f (0x0010)  :  whose surroundings are difficult to make out in the flickering light
0x05d2  /  0x34a0 (0x0027)  : , The floor gives like squelchy elastic beneath your feet, oozing water as it does so, and vivid blotches of fungal growth stain the walls
0x05d3  /  0x34c8 (0x0045)  : . Quartz crystals sparkle, many-coloured, in the walls, and delicate stone pillars soar into darkness, towards an unseen roof. Water cascades over tumescent stone the colour of candy floss, and babbles melodically across the cavern floor in a little runnel
0x05d4  /  0x350f (0x0068)  : , a small cave, carved by the passage of water long since gone, into fantastic shapes and hollows. Here is the likeness of a lion's head; there, a whale sports amid the billowing waves. Crystalline angels flit beneath the roof, their wings alive with gemstones, and on the floor below writhe sparkling snakes, each coil the work of a thousand thousand years
0x05d5  /  0x3579 (0x000c)  :  that creak and quiver ominously beneath your feet
0x05d6  /  0x3586 (0x005b)  :  that would have done credit to Dr. Frankenstein's madder moments. Huge machines lurk against the walls, their sides studded with dials and levers. A hydraulic lift, now hopelessly corroded, reaches up towards the domed roof, and a maniacal network of wires runs from a complicated junction box, up through the dome
0x05d7  /  0x35e3 (0x003e)  : , which is confusing at first, until you get the hang of scrabbling around the glassy-smooth floor and clawing your way into the passage of your choice. (It's a bit like those bowls you get at the bottom of helter-skelters)
0x05d8  /  0x3622 (0x001f)  : , which is a strange place to find yourself at the best of times. Have you checked your sanity lately?
0x05d9  /  0x3642 (0x0010)  : , which is short, made of stone, and generally stereotypical
0x05da  /  0x3653 (0x0033)  : . There are a lot of these about. This one is suspiciously empty, but you receive the impression that it has been until recently in use. A strong smell of formalin lingers in the air
0x05db  /  0x3687 (0x002b)  : . The air sparkles with flecks of multicoloured light, and there is a strange murmuring, as though crowd of people were passing somewhere just out of sight
0x05dc  /  0x36b3 (0x0029)  : . A notice on the wall reads: "No singing, sudden movements, or children allowed. All breakages must be paid for before execution"
0x05dd  /  0x36dd (0x001c)  : , a motley collection of monstrosities on the "chubby child" theme so beloved by previous generations
0x05de  /  0x36fa (0x0025)  : , which has that air of silent awareness that a building acquires after years of abandonment. The curving walls seem to close in around you
0x05df  /  0x3720 (0x001a)  :  that wind round and round a central pillar, their worn stone treads cold beneath your feet
0x05e0  /  0x373b (0x001d)  :  that seem to go on forever. The air feels rarified, as though you are at a great height
0x05e1  /  0x3759 (0x0013)  : , and your head reels from the continual anti-clockwise spiral of your passage
0x05e2  /  0x376d (0x000c)  : , and a cold chill clamps around your heart
0x05e3  /  0x377a (0x000c)  : , and a cold chill clamps around your heart
0x05e4  /  0x3787 (0x000c)  : , and a cold chill clamps around your heart
0x05e5  /  0x3794 (0x000f)  : , among the dust and cobwebs of the northern end
0x05e6  /  0x37a4 (0x0019)  : , so dark that it is impossible to make out any details: all the shapes merge together
0x05e7  /  0x37be (0x0015)  :  like an enclosed cloister, that stretches north and south from where you stand
0x05e8  /  0x37d4 (0x000f)  :  and your every footstep echoes between its fluted pillars
0x05e9  /  0x37e4 (0x0017)  : , at its southern end, where shadows lurk in every corner and hollow echoes sound
0x05ea  /  0x37fc (0x0059)  : , its pale wooden panels inset with flowers of mother-of-pearl and the subtle green stone. Glass display cases stand at intervals around the room, each containing one or two superb examples of carved jade: dragons, laughing Buddhas, horses and warriors; and one sombre-faced likeness of the August Personage of Jade
0x05eb  /  0x3857 (0x0023)  : , where representations of cruel and ancient gods alternate with the death masks of notables from the "Murderers' Who's Who"
0x05ec  /  0x387b (0x0036)  : , a magnificent edifice with walls of white marble, and a floor chequered in black and red tiles. Echoes trickle around the walls, eerily mocking your footsteps and amplifying the sound of your breathing
0x05ed  /  0x38b2 (0x0037)  : , its pointed roof supported on four huge columns of figured marble. Two griffins rampant guard the tops of the two staircases that ascend from the plain below, their mighty wings upraised
0x05ee  /  0x38ea (0x0032)  : , where phantom voices weep and whisper, calling you from far away. Strange lights flicker behind the trembling veils of cloud, and unseen things caress your hands and face
0x05ef  /  0x391d (0x0024)  : , its round sides towering up some twenty metres above you. It is completely empty, and strange echoes run along its walls
0x05f0  /  0x3942 (0x0036)  : , a small chamber, whose walls are carved with the graffiti of a dozen times and tongues. Only one is clear to you. It reads: "Smorzzen hsorke qreirkl vemz? Tnzerwtnz!"
0x05f1  /  0x3979 (0x000f)  : , devoid of anything except an air of lurking terror
0x05f2  /  0x3989 (0x001a)  : , a simple, bijou resting place, fashioned from platinum and diamonds, with ruby trim
0x07d0  /  0x39a8 (0x0004)  : you are on 
0x07d1  /  0x39ad (0x0004)  : you are in 
0x07d3  /  0x39b3 (0x0007)  : you can't use the word 
0x07d4  /  0x39bb (0x0003)  :  like that
0x07d5  /  0x39bf (0x0007)  : I don't know the word 
0x07da  /  0x39c8 (0x000a)  : I don't understand what you mean by that
0x07db  /  0x39d3 (0x0003)  : you can't see
0x07dc  /  0x39d7 (0x0003)  : you don't have
0x07dd  /  0x39db (0x0004)  : you already have
0x07e1  /  0x39e1 (0x0004)  : it's not there. 
0x07e4  /  0x39e7 (0x0005)  : don't be silly. 
0x07e5  /  0x39ed (0x0005)  : strange concept. 
0x07e6  /  0x39f3 (0x0005)  : say what? 
0x07e7  /  0x39f9 (0x0005)  : nice try. 
0x07ee  /  0x3a00 (0x0006)  : leave it alone. 
0x07ef  /  0x3a07 (0x0005)  : forget about it. 
0x07f0  /  0x3a0d (0x0004)  : ignore it. 
0x07f1  /  0x3a12 (0x0009)  : you must supply an object. 
0x07f2  /  0x3a1c (0x0009)  : that verb needs an object. 
0x07f3  /  0x3a26 (0x0007)  : could you elaborate? 
0x07f4  /  0x3a2e (0x0006)  : absolutely nothing happens. 
0x07f7  /  0x3a36 (0x0006)  : what a mouthful!

0x0803  /  0x3a56 (0x0006)  : you can't repeat that. 
0x0804  /  0x3a5d (0x000c)  : it wouldn't help to try that again. 
0x0805  /  0x3a6a (0x000c)  : it's not clear to what IT is referring. 
0x0807  /  0x3a78 (0x0003)  : (removing

0x0819  /  0x3af1 (0x0012)  : the statue gives you a stony look and doesn't accept it. 
0x0820  /  0x3b05 (0x0017)  : Do you really. From your efforts to date, I would never have guessed. 
0x0821  /  0x3b1d (0x0005)  : why not? 
0x0822  /  0x3b23 (0x0008)  : you sound very positive today.

The Red Moon crystal was recovered and guarded for many years, gaining intensity. But its power proved too tempting for one magician; Myglar by name. Thinking to have eternal life, he stole the moon and locked himself away. One last hero would have to defeat this last threat to history and recover the crystal, even if it meant paying the price of magik...

0x0840  /  0x3c11 (0x000b)  : it looks exactly as you would expect. 
0x0841  /  0x3c1d (0x0003)  :  nothing. 
0x0842  /  0x3c21 (0x0008)  : you can't go that way. 
0x0843  /  0x3c2a (0x0007)  : you bump into the door.

0x084b  /  0x3c5b (0x0007)  : you can't put it there.

0x0853  /  0x3c8f (0x0006)  : you're on it!

0x085a  /  0x3cbc (0x0009)  : you can't carry any more. 
0x085b  /  0x3cc6 (0x0004)  : is full.

0x0861  /  0x3ce1 (0x000b)  : that would be a waste of time. 
0x0862  /  0x3ced (0x0005)  : that's pointless.

0x0864  /  0x3cfc (0x0008)  : you don't need to do that. 
0x0865  /  0x3d05 (0x0013)  : you slither down a greasy chute, which slams shut behind you.

0x087f  /  0x3d61 (0x0008)  : "Hullo, boss". 
0x0880  /  0x3d6a (0x000a)  : you polish it till it shines. 
0x0884  /  0x3d76 (0x002e)  : a bolt of lightning sears out of the blue, sizzling past your ears and only just missing you. A deep voice thunders: "Watch your language!"
0x088e  /  0x3da6 (0x0001)  : (
0x088f  /  0x3da8 (0x0002)  : ).

Well done! You have solved the entire trilogy with a display of supreme brilliance, cleverness, ingenuity, intelligence, perspicacity, insight, intuition, sagacity, imagination, wisdom and sheer genius. Not to mention enduring persistence. This proves you to be an intellectual, mastermind and mental giant, all rolled into one. In fact, I'm sure you'd be running the country right now, if you weren't so honest! Congratulations!

0x096c  /  0x40d6 (0x0010)  : that data was probably not saved from Time and Magik. 
0x096d  /  0x40e7 (0x000a)  : play the program cassette containing "

0x09c5  /  0x4126 (0x001d)  : the mandrake screams in terror as you grab its leaves, flailing ineffectually at your hands with its tendrils. 
0x09c6  /  0x4144 (0x0017)  : you brutally wrench it from the ground, and some things fall out of its roots. 
0x09c7  /  0x415c (0x0013)  : you release the leaves and the mandrake heaves a sigh of relief.
0x09c8  /  0x4170 (0x0007)  : it is burning weakly. 
0x09c9  /  0x4178 (0x0013)  : the last of the candle burns away: it flickers and goes out. 
0x09ca  /  0x418c (0x0014)  : the woodpile bursts into flames and within moments is reduced to ashes. 
0x09cb  /  0x41a1 (0x0005)  : you can't light it. 
0x09cc  /  0x41a7 (0x000a)  : you rub the eyebright into your eyes. 
0x09cd  /  0x41b2 (0x0009)  : the mirror is in the way. 
0x09ce  /  0x41bc (0x0016)  : CRASH. CRUNCH. TINKLE. The mirror breaks into thousands of little pieces. 
0x09cf  /  0x41d3 (0x0026)  : you score out a neat circle of glass and tap it gently. As it falls away, the rest of the mirror shimmers and disappears. 
0x09d0  /  0x41fa (0x0009)  : you have no source of fire. 
0x09d1  /  0x4204 (0x001f)  : the nasty suddenly discovers a little hole in the floorboards, and with a chirruping cry of delight slithers into it. 
0x09d2  /  0x4224 (0x0007)  : the candle goes out. 
0x09d3  /  0x422c (0x0004)  : rat-a-tat-tat! 
0x09d4  /  0x4231 (0x001e)  : You gingerly climb the ancient rope, your hands slipping every now and then on its greasy surface. 
0x09d5  /  0x4250 (0x000b)  : the door creaks slowly open... 
0x09d8  /  0x425d (0x000f)  : you can hear vile slithering noises coming towards you. 
0x09d9  /  0x426d (0x000b)  : the squelching noises are getting closer. 
0x09da  /  0x4279 (0x0017)  : A nameless horror rears from the gloom. You pass out from sheer terror. 
0x09db  /  0x4291 (0x0007)  : the noises die away. 
0x09dc  /  0x4299 (0x0003)  : you are 
0x09e2  /  0x429e (0x000a)  : it is less than half burnt. 
0x09e3  /  0x42a9 (0x000a)  : it is more than half burnt. 
0x09e4  /  0x42b4 (0x000c)  : there is only a tiny stump left. 
0x09eb  /  0x42c2 (0x007b)  : the bat disappears into the mist, then after a short time, reappears, dragging a wheel that bobs along a few inches off the ground. The bat is straining fit to bust, its little veins bulging and its ears screwed up with concentration, but it obeys your command faithfully, and only drops the wheel when it can see you again - about two inches from the end of your nose. The wheel lands on your foot. 
0x09ec  /  0x433f (0x002d)  : you almost fall over a wheel that some idiot has left lying about. Fortunately, you regain your balance, but the wheel bowls off out of sight into the mist. 
0x09ed  /  0x436d (0x0014)  : you can't seem to find it. The mist is really very thick in here. 
0x09ee  /  0x4382 (0x000c)  : the panels on the east wall sound hollow. 
0x09ef  /  0x438f (0x0007)  : the panels sound normal. 
0x09f0  /  0x4397 (0x005a)  : you try all the panels in turn, working from the north end, southwards. About two thirds of the way along, one of them gives slightly under your groping fingers, you hear a quiet "snick", and the whole group of panels around the one you have pushed swing open. You have found a secret door. 
0x09f1  /  0x43f3 (0x0008)  : ding. Dong etc. 
0x09f6  /  0x43fd (0x0006)  : the chest is coloured 
0x09f7  /  0x4404 (0x0007)  : the chests are coloured 
0x09f8  /  0x440c (0x0046)  : as you start to lift the lid, there is a flash of light and an enormous explosion. You are flung backwards, slam into the wall, and slide gracefully down it to rest in a crumpled heap upon the floor. Shards of pulverised chest rain down upon you. 
0x09f9  /  0x4454 (0x0005)  : it is closed. 
0x09fa  /  0x445a (0x0007)  :  (which is open)
0x09fb  /  0x4462 (0x0005)  : it is empty. 
0x0a00  /  0x4469 (0x000c)  : it is too far above your head. 
0x0a01  /  0x4476 (0x0009)  : it reads: "HYP". 
0x0a02  /  0x4480 (0x000d)  : you'll need to be much higher than this!
0x0a05  /  0x448f (0x0018)  : the sword abruptly drops from sight, and you hear clattering noises in the room below. 
0x0a06  /  0x44a8 (0x0010)  : you could cut yourself, playing with swords like that. 
0x0a07  /  0x44b9 (0x000c)  : the hilt is firmly fixed in the ceiling. 
0x0a0a  /  0x44c7 (0x0019)  : the curtain is in the way, its velvet folds as immovable as the mountains of Zwang. 
0x0a0b  /  0x44e1 (0x0015)  : your blow lands on the enchanted curtain, and it shimmers and fades away. 
0x0a0f  /  0x44f8 (0x0008)  : you dig a little hole. 
0x0a10  /  0x4501 (0x0008)  : you fill it in again. 
0x0a11  /  0x450a (0x0004)  : you throw 
0x0a12  /  0x450f (0x0005)  : into the hole. 
0x0a13  /  0x4515 (0x0011)  : I think you should fill in your last hole first. 
0x0a14  /  0x4527 (0x000d)  : the ground is too hard for digging here. 
0x0a15  /  0x4535 (0x0008)  : you have nothing to dig with. 
0x0a16  /  0x453e (0x000b)  : you cut a staff from the vine. 
0x0a32  /  0x454b (0x0113)  : the bat flies out of the cage, obviously furious at its imprisonment. "Do you realize how much money you've cost me, keeping me cooped up in that *!@** thing?" It squeaks venomously. 
 
"And what about my work, eh? What do you think will happen without me to do the voice-overs on the phone lines? I'll tell you what will happen - everybody will think the Company's got it right at last, and all those nasty articles will disappear from the papers, and those competitions that give everyone so much fun, you know the "Find Something Nice to Say about Telecom and Win a Free Telegraph Pole" kind of thing, will stop running, and newspaper sales will plummet and they'll lose all that lovely free publicity, that's what will happen. And it will all be your fault! Moron! Fink!" And it beats you about the head with its leathery wings. 
0x0a33  /  0x4663 (0x000d)  : the bat seems to be worried about something. 
0x0a34  /  0x4671 (0x0073)  : the bat sees the bloodworm, (even he can't miss a thing that size) and swoops upon it with a happy cry. The bloodworm howls, turns tail and lollops off into the gloom, hotly pursued by the bat. Unfortunately, the little pest is back within moments, his small shoulders quivering as he tries to get his breath. "Lost the fat ***!" He wheezes bitterly. 
0x0a35  /  0x46e6 (0x000b)  : the bat deftly avoids your grasp. 
0x0a36  /  0x46f2 (0x000b)  : the bat can't manage to lift it. 
0x0a37  /  0x46fe (0x0012)  : the fish tries to grab it with one fin, but fails. 
0x0a38  /  0x4711 (0x000e)  : you can't get a grip on it with your fin. 
0x0a3c  /  0x4721 (0x000d)  : somewhere nearby, you hear a clock strike. 
0x0a3d  /  0x472f (0x0008)  : the clock goes BOM.

Well done, you have won the right to take Myglar's place as guardian of the Red Moon crystal! There are two alternate views of your future. Do you want the good version? 
0x0a6f  /  0x4956 (0x0043)  : you live in a luxurious castle as an all-powerful magician, tended hand and foot by loyal servants. Everyone lives in awe of your wise magik and every millennium is more enjoyable than the last. You have beaten the Price of Magik! 
0x0a70  /  0x499b (0x005b)  : the quest for magik has driven you absolutely stark, staring mad. You spend your time incarcerated in a modern asylum, cared for by efficient nurses. They humour your obsession with chanting arcane gibberish and your screams of "ZAP" and "KIL" when they bring you your cocoa, so it's not a bad life. 
0x0a78  /  0x49f9 (0x003b)  : "Greetings, human", the golem grunts, "We don't get many of your kind down here. I don't suppose you've got anything that I could wear instead of this scratchy mail suit?"

0x0a85  /  0x4aaa (0x0015)  : the voice says impatiently, "That won't do. Absolute rubbish!" 
0x0a86  /  0x4ac0 (0x0012)  : the voice says, "Hmmm. I suppose that will do".

0x0a88  /  0x4ad8 (0x0015)  : the voice says, "One gift is quite sufficient, thank you".

0x0a8d  /  0x4b01 (0x0036)  : there is a loud crack from the monkey, and something falls off with a clatter and rolls along the ground. The monkey leaps from your back and runs away, whimpering, its teeth chattering audibly.

0x0a96  /  0x4b93 (0x0018)  : the ferryman rasps, "Hands off my boat, you ill-mannered little pod! "
0x0a97  /  0x4bac (0x002a)  : the ferryman mutters, "The fee for a crossing is a single item. I don't care what, but I don't want no rubbish. Creep". 
0x0a98  /  0x4bd7 (0x0017)  : the ferryman says grudgingly, "I suppose that will do. Get in, Creep". 
0x0a99  /  0x4bef (0x0017)  : the ferryman pulls doughtily on his oars and the boat moves quietly through the water. 
0x0a9a  /  0x4c07 (0x0021)  : he pulls the boat onto the shore, and waits for you to get out. "So long, Creep", he says.

0x0aa0  /  0x4c62 (0x0032)  : the ferryman stops you. "Oi, Creep, this river is a closed shop", he growls, champing his toothless jaws. "No crossing except by union labour".

0x0c9f  /  0x4dcf (0x006d)  : it comes to life. You see Myglar summoned to the council chamber, right here, in this very building. The assembled elders eye the psychotic wizard with distaste, awaiting his explanations. But, instead of addressing them, he shrieks: "ZAP!" And "KIL!" And hurls jagged lightning across the room. The scene flares, fades, and the wargame is still again
0x0ca0  /  0x4e3e (0x001f)  : it comes to life. The healer looks into your eyes and mutters "FIX" in a cracked and scratchy voice

0x0ca5  /  0x4eb6 (0x0013)  : the werewolves howl in chorus, then the picture becomes still again
0x0ca6  /  0x4eca (0x0021)  : Myglar's image turns, stares from the wakened picture, and taunts you for your lack of success in getting to him. 
0x0ca7  /  0x4eec (0x0011)  : In its frenzy, it breaks a claw on the frame.

0x0d35  /  0x501a (0x0039)  : there is a loud thunderclap as Myglar's magik is neutralized. He crumples as Time regains its power, no longer held at bay by his spells. Finally, nothing remains of the proud wizard but ancient dust
