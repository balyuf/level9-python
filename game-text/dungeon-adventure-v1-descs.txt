0x217  /  0x445a  : on a smooth rock dome, below a narrow path

face
0x21a  /  0x44bb  : standing on an enormous stone nose, projecting far out over the river below. To the south, at the end of the nose, is a large white building dwarfed to the apparant size of a pimple, and above is a great rock dome

0x21c  /  0x453c  : in a stone left ear. Paths lead west and into the rock
0x21d  /  0x4555  : in an arch-way below the gate-house. A bridge leads north to the foot of a shattered black tower. A violet pedestal stands to one side of the arch

0x220  /  0x45ba  : on a ramp down the black tower
0x221  /  0x45cb  : on a dead-end flight of shattered steps
0x222  /  0x45e3  : in the roc's nest, where it brings "food" for storage
0x223  /  0x4604  : south of the river, on the edge of a vast field 
of poppies which stretches west as far as the eye can see. A somnolant perfume hangs heavy on the breeze
0x224  /  0x4655  : on an east-west road, south of the river and north of a steep, treeless hill
0x225  /  0x4674  : on an east-west road beside the river and north 
of a flat grassy plain. A line of stepping stones leads to a small island in the water
0x226  /  0x46b0  : on a mud-bank, north of a wide river. A stone bridge spans the waters, reaching from the granite cliffs above to the flat lands of the far bank, and a path climbs up to it
0x227  /  0x4709  : under the killer-willow tree
0x228  /  0x4718  : on the southern end of a small island, reached by stepping stones from the south. The far end of the island is occupied by a viscious-looking willow tree with six long rubbery branches
0x229  /  0x477c  : on stepping stones leading north to an island
0x22a  /  0x4791  : on the floor of a cavern, beside a clump of evil green toadstools. Liquid slime oozes from the north and paths lead south and up
0x22b  /  0x47cf  : in the middle of the floor of a giant cove, in a giant ants' nest. Small footprints lead north and south
0x22c  /  0x4800  : North of the cave floor, below a huge grey mushroom
0x22d  /  0x4819  : at the end of an aqueduct designed to drip water evenly into the depths of a deep pit below. The aqueduct leads north, a narrow fissure leads south, and steps lead down into the pit
0x22e  /  0x4873  : walking on the bed of an empty aqueduct which crosses a vast dark pit
0x22f  /  0x489a  : in a damp north-south pipe
0x230  /  0x48a7  : on an aqueduct
0x231  /  0x48b1  : in a paved tunnel below a silver pedestal. Water trickles from a silver hoop painted on one wall and seeps south. An armoured door leads east and a crack splits the north wall
0x232  /  0x4909  : standing in shallow water at the foot of the ramp. A ladder slopes northwards to a higher part of the ramp
0x233  /  0x4937  : on a wide spiral ramp which descends clockwise round an immense pit. A small dark tunnel leads north. But these are matters of little significance for the north wall of the tunnel is covered with a miriad moving images of writhing tormented creatures and your gaze is locked on them. Your sanity is draining away!! If you don't act quickly your soul will be captured by the wall
0x234  /  0x49fe  : on the ramp which descends clockwise around the 
edges of a very deep pit. To the east is an opening into a red-gold room
0x235  /  0x4a3a  : on the ramp, beside a doorway with small holes up one edge
0x236  /  0x4a55  : on the ramp, outside a dark doorway

0x238  /  0x4a6f  : on the ramp, outside a round opening
0x239  /  0x4a7e  : on a wobbly section of the ramp
0x23a  /  0x4a8f  : on the ramp, outside a long room with scratches 
on floor and ceiling
0x23b  /  0x4aaf  : on the ramp. A hand sign points into a narrow opening
0x23c  /  0x4acc  : on the ramp, outside a narrow doorway from which drifts a sharp, acrid smell
0x23d  /  0x4af3  : on the ramp, outside a rubbery doorway

0x23f  /  0x4b11  : on the ramp, outside an opening to a pale room
0x240  /  0x4b23  : on the ramp, outside an evil dark entrance
0x241  /  0x4b37  : on the ramp. A ladder slopes southwards to a lower part of the ramp
0x242  /  0x4b54  : on the ramp. A sign over a doorway reads: "Congratulations! You have won a uniquely valuable reward! Just walk in and answer a simple question to claim your prize!"
0x243  /  0x4baf  : You are on deadly slime, slipping towards the edge of the ramp


0x244  /  0x4bcd  : on the ramp outside an ornate entrance. The ramp above looks dodgy
0x245  /  0x4bf0  : on the ramp. A doorway bears the following message: "To escape the dungeon, collect 9 gems and go through this door. Leaving without the gems will cause your death". Clearly you must be in the central dungeon of the Demon Lord!
0x246  /  0x4c6b  : on the ramp, outside a doorway
0x247  /  0x4c76  : on the ramp
0x248  /  0x4c7a  : on a massive spiral ramp which twists down into 
dark waters and up into the gloom above. Sea-spray wafts from a nearby doorway

passages

0x2ae  /  0x59cd  : in the guard room. An exit leads north
0x2af  /  0x59de  : in the "Skinner box": a blank room with no way out - just nine buttons in a vertical line up one wall. The buttons are numbered 1 to 9 and a discrete notice reads "choose the best"
0x2b0  /  0x5a44  : in the reward room. This is empty too and has only 5 numbered buttons, labelled as follows...

 1: Great wealth;

 2: Eternal life;

 3: World peace;

 4: Mystery prize;

 5: Nothing.

A sign invites you to choose your prize
0x2b1  /  0x5acf  : in the statue room. An incomprehensible abstract sculpture of hoops, spirals and loops sprawls around on a small circular platform in the middle of the floor. The entrance is to the west

0x2bd  /  0x5bf4  : on the carpetted floor of a comfortable homely room, beside a door to the east.
0x2be  /  0x5c17  : in a large store room. You realise that this is 
the ideal place to leave any treasures that you 
find, so as to get full points for them. Doors lead west and to the outside. A machine resembling a six-foot cube with a single red button sits 
in one corner
0x2bf  /  0x5c9f  : in a smooth, round north-south passage. A flickering light is visible to the north
0x2c0  /  0x5cc2  : at a junction in the round, north-south passage, illuminated by a jet of flame from the floor.

To the east is a treasure vault, completely filled with valuables of every kind

0x2ca  /  0x5e43  : in a winding, sticky east-west passage to the outside

0x2cc  /  0x5e7d  : in a gloomy cavern, between rows of jagged, pointed stalagmites. A fetid odour drifts from a wide round passage to the north
0x2cd  /  0x5ec1  : 717
0x2ce  /  0x5ec5  : 718
0x2cf  /  0x5ec9  : 719

0x2d5  /  0x5f0e  : in the repository for bugs
0x2d6  /  0x5f1e  : A hollow voice intones: "This is your referee speaking. If you continue on this road you will return safe to civilisation and the game will end. Are you sure that you want to?"


0x2d7  /  0x5f84  : The poppy scent overcomes you...
0x2d8  /  0x5f99  : The ground is too slippery!
0x2d9  /  0x5fa8  : 
0x2da  /  0x5fa9  : The rings dodge
0x2db  /  0x5fb4  : The ring grabs your finger and grows rapidly..

You shrink rapidly..
0x2dc  /  0x5fdc  : A flying hand throttles you
0x2dd  /  0x5fed  : The ring lands in the hand room. You hear a struggle, then silence<EOM>
