0x12d  /  0x343c  : lost in the forest
0x12e  /  0x3444  : lost in the forest
0x12f  /  0x344c  : lost in the forest
0x130  /  0x3454  : lost in the forest
0x131  /  0x345c  : lost in the forest beside a huge oak tree with branches resting on the ground
0x132  /  0x3481  : in dense forest, surrounded by clinging plants and small biting insects
0x133  /  0x34a1  : at the end of a road from the north, outside a small brick building. A river flows south through a narrow valley and there is dense woodland all around
0x134  /  0x34ea  : in a narrow north-south valley through the forest. A small stream, clogged by dead vegetation, seeps sluggishly south. A miasma of decay pervades the scene
0x135  /  0x353a  : in a north-south valley. A small steam flows from the north and seeps away into the swampy ground
0x136  /  0x3565  : in a 20 foot deep depression in the floor of a steep valley. The remains of an iron grate can just be made out, set into the ground, but it is blocked by concrete and has almost rusted away
0x137  /  0x35c3  : stumbling over sharp stones in a steeply sloping gulley
0x138  /  0x35e0  : at the top of a high cliff which slices across the land. Far below you are the southern lowlands: once a prosperous farming area but now devastated by drought, plague and war. A few animals roam the dry fields
0x139  /  0x3654  : on the steep east side of a valley, overgrown with brambles and stinging plants
0x13a  /  0x367c  : at the base of a stone pinnacle which rises from the gloom of the trees into the sunlight above. A narrow path spirals round it, climbing upwards
0x13b  /  0x36c7  : on a road north of the building. All around is desolate scrub-land where sparse weeds strive for life in the poisoned ground
0x13c  /  0x370a  : at the edge of the 'fertile' land. Nothing grows in the desert which stretches north as far as the eye can see. Heat haze blurs your vision, but you can just make out the shape of a high mountain within it
0x13d  /  0x3777  : sitting on a gnarled tree-branch which is half-split from its parent trunk and resting on the ground
0x13e  /  0x37ad  : in the building. Steps lead down a well in the centre of the floor. A white dot is marked over the door
0x13f  /  0x37de  : in the well. A message on the wall says "Congratulations on bringing light to the dark well! Give yourself a 1000 point bonus for being lucky!!"
0x140  /  0x3832  : in a small woodland clearing carpetted with buttercups and sweet grasses
0x141  /  0x3859  : in a grove of tall trees, relics of the original "Great Forest" which covered this area before the coming of the Desolation
0x142  /  0x3899  : on a path through dense forest
0x143  /  0x38a8  : in woodland above the valley. A path leads north into dense forest
0x144  /  0x38c9  : on a path winding round the rock pinnacle
0x145  /  0x38dc  : at the top of a stone pinnacle high above the forest. A steep escarpment falls away to the south, leading down to once-fertile lowlands. A forest of tangled trees smothers the higher land around you and to the north is baked desert. A mountain rises above the sands, and you can just make out a stone tower on its slopes
0x146  /  0x397b  : on trackless desert
0x147  /  0x397f  : on trackless desert
0x148  /  0x3983  : on trackless desert

0x14b  /  0x398f  : on trackless desert
0x14c  /  0x3993  : on trackless desert beside a black pillar. The pillar is round, and perfectly smooth but for a single white dot half-way up
0x14d  /  0x39cf  : on trackless desert above a deep canyon. A small oasis sits in the bottom of the canyon, nestling at the foot of the southern cliffs below
0x14e  /  0x3a08  : on trackless desert south of a canyon
0x14f  /  0x3a13  : on trackless desert south of a canyon. A large flat-topped pyramid with steps on all sides rises from the desert, and to the east an outcrop ofpolished rock resists the shifting sands
0x150  /  0x3a6b  : inside a small temple to the sun god on the pyramid. It is surrounded by stone pillars and has a large central altar, but is roofless of course
0x151  /  0x3aae  : on top of the pyramid outside a small temple
0x152  /  0x3ac2  : on a rocky outcrop overlooking the desert and the pyramid. A path leads down to the north into a chasm between the outcrop and its parent mountain
0x153  /  0x3b09  : at the southern edge of a vast desert, baked by 
the burning sun. Great lines of dunes seem to march north
0x154  /  0x3b3e  : beside giant rocks which block the valley
0x155  /  0x3b53  : in a dry east-west canyon with sheer rocky walls
0x156  /  0x3b6b  : in a dry canyon. Cliffs tower overhead and you can see an oasis to the south
0x157  /  0x3b8f  : on the side of a mountain rising from the desert
0x158  /  0x3ba4  : in a sheltered wadi. Oil seeps from the rocks
0x159  /  0x3bbb  : where the wadi ends at a mountain. You could climb up
0x15a  /  0x3bdb  : at the north edge of an oasis
0x15b  /  0x3be8  : in an oasis beside a deep pool of cool water
0x15c  /  0x3bff  : swimming in a clear desert pool
0x15d  /  0x3c10  : in a looted treasure cave. It has been cleaned out completely and on one wall is written "Ali wuz here"!
0x15e  /  0x3c48  : in a sheltered east-west valley, protected from 
the burning sun by high rocky walls
0x15f  /  0x3c73  : on a stone staircase zig-zagging up the mountain
0x160  /  0x3c8e  : on a stone staircase up the mountain
0x161  /  0x3ca0  : on the stone staircase some distance below a stone tower. A body hangs from a gallows and a notice reads "KEEP AWAY OR YOU WILL DIE"
0x162  /  0x3cf5  : on an east-west track round the mountain
0x163  /  0x3d06  : on a climbing path up the mountain
0x164  /  0x3d17  : on a track up the mountain
0x165  /  0x3d24  : on a sheep-track leading upwards
0x166  /  0x3d35  : on a sheep-track looping back round the mountain
0x167  /  0x3d4c  : on stone steps some way above a stone tower. A narrow path joins the stairway from the west
0x168  /  0x3d7d  : on steps leading upwards
0x169  /  0x3d89  : on a bleak rocky mountainside buffetted by cruel winds which whistle round the peak. A wide stone staircase leads down to the lower slopes
0x16a  /  0x3dce  : on a steep path through sparse vegetation hung with tatters of bleached lichin
0x16b  /  0x3df5  : standing on a snowfield outside a small dark mountain cave
0x16c  /  0x3e10  : in a smelly cave: the sound of running water reverberates from the walls. A white dot is marked 
on the roof, and at the back of the cave is a sheer drop down into darkness
0x16d  /  0x3e63  : outside the south door of a stone tower which stands astride the stairway
0x16e  /  0x3e85  : outside the north door of the tower
0x16f  /  0x3e93  : in the south tower room. A spiral staircase leads upwards and there are doors to south and east
0x170  /  0x3ec1  : in the north tower room. Doors lead north and south
0x171  /  0x3ed9  : in a small room used by the orc guards
0x172  /  0x3eeb  : on a tight spiral staircase up the inside of the tower
0x173  /  0x3f04  : on a spiral staircase half-way up the tower
0x174  /  0x3f1b  : outside a small door. A foul smell seeps from behind it
0x175  /  0x3f38  : in a small gloomy room with an alcove in the north wall
0x176  /  0x3f50  : in a tiny alcove at the back of a squalid room
0x177  /  0x3f68  : on a wide stone staircase climbing up the mountain. A narrow uneven path joins it from the westand leads round the mountain
0x178  /  0x3fa6  : on a ledge. It collapses, hurling you into a fast-flowing underground river! You are swept along helplessly
0x179  /  0x3fe5  : in a raging torrent
0x17a  /  0x3fef  : buffeted by the swift current
0x17b  /  0x4002  : swept round a bend in the river
0x17c  /  0x4014  : in a series of rapids
0x17d  /  0x401f  : on the brink of a stretch of rapids
0x17e  /  0x4032  : tossed around by the rapids
0x17f  /  0x4042  : in a quiet pool below the rapids and near a gravel beach
0x180  /  0x4062  : on a featureless lake-bed
0x181  /  0x4071  : on the lake-bed. A huge clam is firmly rooted to the rocks
0x182  /  0x4091  : on the lake bed
0x183  /  0x4099  : on the lake bed
0x184  /  0x40a1  : on the lake bed above a deep dark trench
0x185  /  0x40b8  : on the lake bed above a deep dark trench
0x186  /  0x40cf  : safe in a thick mass of water weed
0x187  /  0x40e3  : in a drowned grave yard, outside a church. A ringing sound can be heard
0x188  /  0x4108  : inside the drowned church. A slow ringing can be heard from the west, behind the pulpit
0x189  /  0x4135  : inside the belfry, below a tolling bell
0x18a  /  0x4148  : at the west end of an underwater trench. A swift current flows away through a small gap in the rocks
0x18b  /  0x417a  : at the east end of an underwater trench, outside a small cave. You think that there may be movement in the cave
0x18c  /  0x41b0  : in shallow water at the edge of the lake
0x18d  /  0x41c2  : inside an octopus lair. The water is warm and there is a white dot on the wall
0x18e  /  0x41e5  : on a small gravel beach to the south of a lake in a volcanic crater. You can see a door on the opposite shore, almost hidden in deep shadows
0x18f  /  0x4229  : on a ledge along the side of a deep chasm, above a swift river
0x190  /  0x4248  : on a ledge above a series of rapids
0x191  /  0x425b  : south of a huge door on the north shore of the crater lake. A host of carved stone heads glare at you from above the door, seeming to follow your every move. To the east is a second, smaller entrance, marked with a black dot
0x192  /  0x42cc  : at the south of a magnificent cave with holes all around. A huge door stands open behind you
0x193  /  0x42fc  : at a dead end
0x194  /  0x4305  : in the centre of a magnificent cave. A web-covered stalagmite reaches upwards towards the sculpted roof
0x195  /  0x4340  : clinging to a web-covered stalagmite. The cavern floor is far below
0x196  /  0x4366  : in the middle of a huge web at the top of the stalagmite. A thick web walkway continues upwards
0x197  /  0x439b  : in the lair of a giant spider, surrounded by a maze of web strands
0x198  /  0x43b9  : at a dead end decorated with ornate carvings cut into the rock
0x199  /  0x43db  : at the north of a magnificent cave with holes all around
0x19a  /  0x43fa  : in a small dead-end room. An ancient statue of a warrior elf stands in the centre. One of his eyes is covered by a jewelled patch - the other is missing
0x19b  /  0x4447  : in an east-west passage decorated with carvings
0x19c  /  0x4461  : in a sloping corridoor warmed by rising hot air
0x19d  /  0x4478  : at a dead end
0x19e  /  0x4481  : in a steeply-sloping east-west passage which winds upwards through the rock
0x19f  /  0x44a7  : at a junction between north-south and east-west 
passages
0x1a0  /  0x44c5  : on a ledge clinging to the west wall of a huge cavern. The cavern floor is just visible, far below
0x1a1  /  0x44f7  : on a ledge which clings to the west wall of a large cavern
0x1a2  /  0x4516  : trapped at a dead end
0x1a3  /  0x4524  : at the entrance to an orc lair. Crude passages are hacked to east and south and an opening looks out over the east side of an immense cavern. The lair is unguarded
0x1a4  /  0x4575  : in a smelly store-room
0x1a5  /  0x4580  : in a feast-hall full of celebrating orcs. You'll have to guess what they are feasting upon
0x1a6  /  0x45b5  : in a jagged north-south passage. The roof is supported by rotting tree-trunks. The noise of a celebration comes from an opening to the east
0x1a7  /  0x45fd  : at the end of the passage: it is blocked by a cave-in. A narrow opening leads west
0x1a8  /  0x4625  : in a tiny store-room
0x1a9  /  0x462f  : in a mass of giant rocks
0x1aa  /  0x463c  : in a sloping corridoor lit from the west by a weird flickering light. The floor and walls feel warm to the touch
0x1ab  /  0x4676  : in a round smooth cave with several exits
0x1ac  /  0x468f  : in the dragon's lair. The floor is covered in gold coins but, sadly for you, the dragon's breath has fused them solid. "Why don't all dragons do this", you wonder
0x1ad  /  0x46eb  : in a cave overlooking a huge volcanic crater
0x1ae  /  0x4700  : on a ledge over the crater. A path spirals anticlockwise to a cave far below
0x1af  /  0x4725  : on a ledge north-east of the crater
0x1b0  /  0x4731  : on a ledge north-west of the crater
0x1b1  /  0x473c  : on a ledge west of the crater, opposite two caves on the far side. The path slopes up towards one cave and down to the other
0x1b2  /  0x4778  : on a ledge south-west of the crater
0x1b3  /  0x4784  : on a ledge south-east of the crater
0x1b4  /  0x4791  : on a ledge east of the volcanic crater, beside a cave entrance. The heat from the bubbling lava 
just below is immense. A path slopes up clockwise to another cave high above
0x1b5  /  0x47e8  : in a cave opening onto a volcanic crater. A huge hole almost fills the cave floor and a ramp spirals down into it. Warning runes are carved at the top of the ramp
0x1b6  /  0x4835  : on a spiral ramp at the top of Hell-well. The walls of the well are inset with small niches containing small flickering lights
0x1b7  /  0x4869  : on a spiral ramp half way up Hell-well. The walls are inset with small niches containing trapped flames
0x1b8  /  0x489a  : on a spiral ramp near the bottom of Hell-well. The walls of the well are inset with small niches holding tiny flames
0x1b9  /  0x48cd  : standing on shattered rocks at the bottom of Hell-well. A broken door leads west
0x1ba  /  0x48ed  : at a crossing between passages. The floor is made up of red-hot coals
0x1bb  /  0x4914  : in a hot room. The north door is marked with a black dot
0x1bc  /  0x492e  : in an ornate room decorated with symbols of infinity. A nest burns on a marble plinth in the centre of the room: yet it is not consumed, and neither does it give off any smoke or heat
0x1bd  /  0x4994  : in a hot east-west corridor. To the east is a bed of glowing coals
0x1be  /  0x49b2  : standing by the alter
0x1bf  /  0x49bb  : on the east side of a bottomless chasm
0x1c0  /  0x49ce  : on a narrow stone bridge poised over the chasm
0x1c1  /  0x49e4  : on the west of the chasm. Steps lead up to an altar above you
0x1c2  /  0x4a03  : iQ a very hot passage. The floor is covered by hot coals to the west
0x1c3  /  0x4a27  : on a bleak moor
0x1c4  /  0x4a2c  : on a bleak moor above swirling mists. A black tower rises above the fog to the south

0x1cf  /  0x4ae6  : on a bleak moor above swirling mists
0x1d0  /  0x4af3  : on a bleak moor south of a barrow-topped hill
0x1d1  /  0x4b07  : on a hill-top outside a long barrow. The lintel 
over the door of the barrow is marked with a black dot. The hill is surrounded on three sides by sheer cliffs and from the other orcs are closing in
0x1d2  /  0x4b64  : on a tiny ledge clinging to a steep cliff
0x1d3  /  0x4b7a  : on a bleak moor above a deep ravine
0x1d4  /  0x4b88  : on a bleak moor above swirling mists

0x1d8  /  0x4bc6  : on a bleak moor above swirling mists. A black tower rises above the fog to the south
0x1d9  /  0x4be3  : on a bleak moor. A path leads down into a ravine
0x1da  /  0x4bf7  : on a steep path in a deep ravine. A black tower 
rises above the fog to the south
0x1db  /  0x4c1b  : on a bleak moor
0x1dc  /  0x4c20  : on a north-south path winding through a dank marsh. Bubbles of gas pop round you
0x1dd  /  0x4c4b  : surrounded by a circle of thirteen standing stones on a small hill in the marsh. There is a dead silence
0x1de  /  0x4c71  : lost in the marsh! There is no visible path
0x1df  /  0x4c87  : on a narrow east-west path between pools of stinking water
0x1e0  /  0x4ca3  : lost in the marsh. A light beckons in the east
0x1e1  /  0x4cb6  : lost in the marsh
0x1e2  /  0x4cbb  : in deadly quicksand
0x1e3  /  0x4cc9  : lost in the marsh. A light flickers from the east
0x1e4  /  0x4cdf  : deep in the marsh. You can see a lantern in the 
east
0x1e5  /  0x4cf6  : deep in the marsh with no way out. Every way you look seems blocked by areas of quicksand. A Will o'Wisp dances overhead in triumph
0x1e6  /  0x4d46  : on a north-south path through the marsh
0x1e7  /  0x4d53  : on a path deep in the marsh
0x1e8  /  0x4d5d  : lost in the marsh
0x1e9  /  0x4d62  : on an east-west causeway through the marsh
0x1ea  /  0x4d72  : in deadly quicksand
0x1eb  /  0x4d80  : on an island outside the door of an ancient house. Lightning flashes, illuminating bats flying overhead, and gusts of wind rattle the flapping shutters
0x1ec  /  0x4dd0  : in a ancient panelled entrance hall of a decaying house. Rats scurry behind the walls. There are doors to north and south
0x1ed  /  0x4e10  : in the main hall. Steps lead upwards
0x1ee  /  0x4e23  : in a high room. A window looks out onto the marsh to the south, and you catch a glimpse of a huge black tower nearby
0x1ef  /  0x4e5c  : on a small ledge south of a small door marked with a black dot. There is a window in the wall above
0x1f0  /  0x4e86  : on a dark granite ramp at the foot of the BLACK 
TOWER
0x1f1  /  0x4ea4  : on slippery steps behind falling mists
0x1f2  /  0x4eb9  : on steps behind a waterfall. Water drips from every stone

0x1f4  /  0x4efb  : at the foot of a flight of steps leading upwards through the mist
0x1f5  /  0x4f18  : below the Door of Rock. A small opening in the door is just large enough to take one of the Stones
0x1f6  /  0x4f41  : below the Door of Gold. A small opening in the door is just large enough to take one of the Stones
0x1f7  /  0x4f6b  : below the Door of Silver. A small opening is just large enough to take one of the Stones
0x1f8  /  0x4f92  : below the Door of Glass. You can see nothing behind the door. An opening is large enough for a Stone
0x1f9  /  0x4fc3  : at the south of a magnificent throne-room
0x1fa  /  0x4fd8  : at an open doorway in a narrow north-south corridor
0x1fb  /  0x4ff2  : in front of a carved granite throne in a magnificent room lined with decorated leather. This seems to be fashioned from human skin
0x1fc  /  0x503b  : at a crossing of passages
0x1fd  /  0x5049  : at a dead end
0x1fe  /  0x5052  : at a dead end
