0x0257  /  0x0f52 (0x0004)  : with a jump
0x0259  /  0x0f58 (0x0041)  : the second best knight in the world, now that his son Galahad stood first among the flowers of chivalry. YOU could tell that he retained the strength of youth with sword and lance, and combined it with the valuable wisdom of his middle years
0x025a  /  0x0f9b (0x0025)  : a knight, clad in full armour, as huge and black as any bear. He held his lance UNDER his arm and glowered at Lancelot
0x025b  /  0x0fc1 (0x002a)  : a wise old man, well steeped in faith and philosophy. He needed no sword nor axe, for his knowledge of hidden SECRETS was power enough
0x025d  /  0x0fed (0x0049)  : a stolid man, not clever but deep-thinking nonetheless. He strove always to do that which was right, to live always in accord with his sense of chivalry and Christian duty. He was a brave knight and well respected in the jousts, a fair but fearless fighter
0x025e  /  0x1038 (0x0013)  : a parfait gentle knight, good-hearted and innocent in the ways of the world
0x025f  /  0x104c (0x0042)  : a sturdy knight with a surcoat and shield of deepest blue and green, the design and colours echoing the patterns of light and shade in the forest. Seated in the sunlight, he reminded Lancelot of Arthur's FATHER-IN-LAW, at one with the woodland around
0x0260  /  0x1090 (0x0049)  : the best knight in world, in chivalry and virtue surpassing even Lancelot, his father. His armour shone brilliantly, as if with an inner light. With his long spear of white ash he cut a striking figure - one that WON hope for those in distress
0x0261  /  0x10db (0x0060)  : more than two score knights clad in dark, unpolished armour and mounted on dark, dirty horses. In each mailed fist was ESPY'D a battle-axe, mace, spear or sword, poised to strike without honour or mercy at any who stood in their way. For all there were so many of them, no human sounds came from that company
0x0262  /  0x113d (0x003e)  : an aged man with a kindly, florid face and wisps of thin grey hair frilling his woollen skull cap. He wore a black tabard over his white robe with a thick leather belt around his ample waist
0x0263  /  0x117c (0x004a)  : a pitiful sight. He lay prostrate upon the ground, so wasted by sun and wind that his flapping robe seemed as if it BELONGED to a much bigger man. From time to time, he would muster his failing strength to utter a pained murmur of "Water, water"
0x0265  /  0x11c9 (0x007b)  : a most comely and alluring young woman, slender and well-made. Lancelot wondered what was the point of CHIVALRY as he looked at her skin, fair and soft as a gentle breeze, her eyes, blue and clear as a Summer sky, and her lustrous tresses, as golden as shimmering sunlight. Her garments were of the finest silk from distant Arabie, and her dress clung gently to the soft contours of her body and caressed her shapely legs
0x0266  /  0x1246 (0x0069)  : a thin, shabby figure of a man, wearing a thin, patched robe. The garb and the tonsure showed he was a cleric; a pale, pinched face and scrawny neck told of frequent hunger. Yet for all his obvious poverty and suffering, he had the air of a man of unbroken spirit, of stoic endurance of the pains of this world and hope for the future
0x0267  /  0x12b1 (0x0032)  : a group of Benedictine monks, tall and short, thin and fat but all with matching tonsures and brown robes. They waited patiently, knowing all would come to pass in time
0x0271  /  0x12e5 (0x0032)  : ferocious beasts, slashing at the air with savage claws, black lips drawn back and red-rimmed jaws agape as they roared their bloodlust. They stared and lunged at Lancelot with murderous intent
0x0272  /  0x1318 (0x004c)  : a huge dragon, red as the fires of Hell, with a great barrel of a body and a long snaking neck. A double row of murderous sharp vanes stood up the length of his back and down his massive tail. His foul, fiery breath scorched the earth around
0x0273  /  0x1366 (0x0048)  : an evil travesty of a human shape. The leathered skull, with its serpentine tongue and eyes of flame, menaced from beneath the shimmering black cowl of its foul robe that surged and writhed about its rattling body. Taloned fingers reached grasping towards Lancelot
0x0274  /  0x13b0 (0x003f)  : a great black beast, wreathed in thick, dark smoke that gushed from its nostrils and rose in plumes from the living furnace of its body. Its barbed wings stretched out, darkening the sky and casting night's gloom upon the ground
0x0275  /  0x13f1 (0x0015)  : untouchable, invisible. Knowable only by the great sense of evil that it engendered
0x02a8  /  0x1408 (0x0032)  : an INSPIRING crown of gold, beset with rubies and emeralds, and topped with a diamond as big as a mailed fist. A great treasure, and a clearly a source of great power
0x02a9  /  0x143b (0x0021)  : a large round plate of solid silver, made LONG-AGO, delicately engraved with nude figures all about its scalloped edges
0x02aa  /  0x145d (0x0015)  : food fit for the saints in heaven. A triumph of the baker's art
0x02ab  /  0x1473 (0x0029)  : golden-brown and full of sweet goodness. Beautifully decorated and delicately scented, they delighted the eye and the nose and promised yet more delights for the tongue
0x02ac  /  0x149d (0x0034)  : freshly baked and still warm, filling the air with the smells of honey and spices. They had been iced carefully with fine icing, and decorated with exotic patterns of angelica and almonds
0x02ad  /  0x14d2 (0x001d)  : the body of a false christian, an unbeliever whose presence was a focus of evil in the consecrated ground
0x02ae  /  0x14f0 (0x002e)  : of silver with an ivory stem. It was perfectly proportioned and intricately worked in the ancient fashion, with a beaten pattern of interwoven vines around its rim and base
0x02af  /  0x151f (0x0034)  : a valuable shield, said to have been saintly JOSEPH'S, he of ARIMATHEA, and to be for the best knight in the Land. Its cognizance was a blood red cross on a background of virgin white
0x02b0  /  0x1554 (0x002f)  : a polished ram's horn with a mouthpiece of pewter and bands of copper at intervals along its length. It may have been made for the hunt, or to sound the tournament
0x02b1  /  0x1584 (0x004f)  : a blessed sword with a pommel of stone and a haft made of the ribs of two beasts, that gave FAMED powers to he who wielded it. It was inscribed with words, in a script like lightning, "There shall never KNIGHTS begrip him but one, but he shall pass all other"
0x02b2  /  0x15d5 (0x0029)  : of thick iron, blackened and pitted with age. It had intricate, but hefty wards, a long shaft and a flattened loop for a handle
0x02b3  /  0x15ff (0x003e)  : made of bronze. It had a simple unadorned bowl, dimmed and dented by the passage of years. The junction between its short stem and wide base had been damaged, so that the cup stood a little out of kilter
0x02bc  /  0x163f (0x000e)  : a handsome chalice filled with fresh sweet water
0x02bd  /  0x164e (0x0019)  : a decorated chalice brimming with salt water, giving off a faint scent of the sea
0x02be  /  0x1668 (0x000a)  : a gleaming chalice of heady mead
0x02bf  /  0x1673 (0x0016)  : a scratched chalice full of dry white sand, glinting softly in the light
0x02c1  /  0x168b (0x0001)  : full
0x02c2  /  0x168d (0x0001)  : full
0x02c3  /  0x168f (0x0001)  : full
0x02c4  /  0x1691 (0x0001)  : full
0x02d9  /  0x1694 (0x002c)  : made of great slabs of stone. It was undecorated, but bore the daunting inscription, "Only the best knight in the world may open this tomb and live"
0x02da  /  0x16c1 (0x002b)  : a single block of limestone, carved all around with holy scenes. A valuable embroidered cloth lay upon it, its gold tassles LEFT hanging down the sides
0x02dc  /  0x16ee (0x00a1)  : a most mysterious apparition. A fine craft of white cedar, carved by axe before the world was FLOODED. It was covered over with a cloth of sheerest white samite. It waited by the shore, riding the tide effortlessly with no crew upon its deck, no hand upon its tiller. Magic spindles of green, white and red all made of the wood of the Eden tree, hung from a great bed that lay within. As Lancelot looked upon the barge, he sensed the holy power that was vested in it, and knew that its guide must needs be a more worthy knight than he
0x02dd  /  0x1792 (0x0035)  : nearly blocking the track with a dense tangle of briers, all covered with thorns as long and sharp as spears. This was a vale of tears indeed, if one strayed from the true path
0x02de  /  0x17c8 (0x000a)  : the most revered item in all Christendom
0x02df  /  0x17d3 (0x0038)  : brilliantly coloured and hung about with bright carpets. The entrance had been drawn back in welcome, revealing the rich furnishings within. Delicate fragrances drifted through the doorway and mingled with the scent of flowers
0x02e0  /  0x180c (0x0033)  : large and soft, filled with fine down and laid with sheets of satin all delicately embroidered with richly coloured silks. This was a bed made for sweet sleep and sweeter pleasures
0x02e1  /  0x1840 (0x0034)  : an impassible barrier that stretched from sea to sea. Full high they roared, red as the fires of damnation, not faltering nor flickering, yet the source of those flames could not be seen
0x02e2  /  0x1875 (0x003f)  : a large crescent of freshly blown sand, its windward surface rippled like the sea and rising up to end in a sharp rim. There the gusting breeze blew flurries of sand that whirled about before tumbling down the lee side
0x02e3  /  0x18b6 (0x0027)  : seemed to be full to the brim with pure, clear water. Yet, as Lancelot leant towards its surface, the waters sank away out of reach
0x02e4  /  0x18de (0x0032)  : a stony cross bearing the inscription, "This way to peace" (pointing to the northeast) and, "This way to death" (pointing to the southeast)
0x02e5  /  0x1911 (0x003c)  : the height of a man and fashioned in the Gaelic manner, with a circle at the juncture of arms and upright. The surface had been carved with flowing patterns, and smoothed by the sands that blew across the waste
0x02ef  /  0x194f (0x0039)  : a great beam set upright into the ground, and piled all around with branches and brushwood. Atop this unlit pyre stood the goodly knight Sir Galahad, lashed to the stake as helpless as a lamb bound for slaughter
0x02f0  /  0x1989 (0x0027)  : wide and turbulent flowing softly to the south. Marsh marigolds tumbled down its banks and bullrushes nodded their heavy heads on the nether side
0x030c  /  0x19b2 (0x002d)  : a barren windy place. Salt spray and stinging sand filled the air, yet even their bluster could not mask the stink of dank mud and sour pools
0x030d  /  0x19e0 (0x002d)  : a rugged island, its grey cliffs rising high above its narrow rocky beach. Atop the cliffs, wind-bent trees turned their backs on the wild sea
0x030e  /  0x1a0e (0x0004)  : a sand dune
0x030f  /  0x1a13 (0x0036)  : a light lattice of pale wood, yet endowed with the power to resist the unworthy. In the archway above were inscribed the words, "Let only he who is without sin pass beneath"
0x03eb  /  0x1a4c (0x0006)  : in a bleak wasteland
0x03ec  /  0x1a53 (0x0004)  : at a ford
0x03ed  /  0x1a58 (0x0008)  : on an east-west woodland road
0x03ef  /  0x1a62 (0x0005)  : in shady woodland
0x03f0  /  0x1a68 (0x0006)  : on a thorny track
0x03f1  /  0x1a6f (0x0004)  : at a fork
0x03f2  /  0x1a74 (0x0008)  : on a track leading east
0x03f4  /  0x1a7e (0x000a)  : on a paved road leading north
0x03f5  /  0x1a89 (0x0007)  : outside a fine church
0x03f7  /  0x1a92 (0x000b)  : on a path that wound up the cliff
0x03f8  /  0x1a9e (0x0006)  : on a small hillock
0x03f9  /  0x1aa5 (0x000f)  : on a path leading north along a cliff top
0x03fa  /  0x1ab5 (0x000a)  : on a path through a pine wood
0x03fb  /  0x1ac0 (0x0009)  : at a clearing amongst the pines
0x03fc  /  0x1aca (0x000b)  : on a path straggling down from a hillock
0x03fd  /  0x1ad6 (0x0006)  : on an overgrown path
0x03fe  /  0x1add (0x0006)  : in a blackened clearing
0x03ff  /  0x1ae4 (0x0004)  : on a pavement
0x0401  /  0x1aea (0x0006)  : in a dark valley
0x0405  /  0x1af2 (0x0006)  : on a rocky path
0x0406  /  0x1af9 (0x0006)  : on a steep path
0x0407  /  0x1b00 (0x000d)  : on a path near the top of a cliff
0x0408  /  0x1b0e (0x0009)  : on a path outside a hermitage
0x0409  /  0x1b18 (0x0005)  : in Nacien's hermitage
0x040a  /  0x1b1e (0x0009)  : at the crossing of two roads
0x040b  /  0x1b28 (0x0006)  : on a stony road
0x040c  /  0x1b2f (0x0006)  : on a forest ride
0x040d  /  0x1b36 (0x0005)  : beside a well
0x040e  /  0x1b3c (0x000a)  : in the white ABBEY [aka] abbey
0x040f  /  0x1b47 (0x0008)  : at the base of a cliff
0x0410  /  0x1b50 (0x0006)  : in a woodland glade
0x0411  /  0x1b57 (0x0008)  : in a flower strewn glade
0x0412  /  0x1b60 (0x0006)  : on a sand dune
0x041a  /  0x1b68 (0x0005)  : in Vagon castle
0x041b  /  0x1b6e (0x0006)  : in an airy pavilion
0x041c  /  0x1b75 (0x0005)  : inside the church
0x041d  /  0x1b7b (0x0004)  : in a castle
0x041e  /  0x1b80 (0x0006)  : in a majestic corridor
0x041f  /  0x1b87 (0x0006)  : in the Grail chamber
0x0420  /  0x1b8e (0x0004)  : in an antechapel
0x0459  /  0x1b94 (0x0006)  : on the south-west shore
0x045a  /  0x1b9b (0x0003)  : on the sea
0x045b  /  0x1b9f (0x0007)  : on the isle of Turnance
0x045c  /  0x1ba7 (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x045d  /  0x1bac (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x045e  /  0x1bb1 (0x0006)  : on a western shore
0x045f  /  0x1bb8 (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x0460  /  0x1bbd (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x0461  /  0x1bc2 (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x0462  /  0x1bc7 (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x0463  /  0x1bcc (0x0006)  : on a bleak shore
0x0464  /  0x1bd3 (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x0465  /  0x1bd8 (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x0466  /  0x1bdd (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x0467  /  0x1be2 (0x0006)  : on a dark shore
0x0468  /  0x1be9 (0x0006)  : on the north-west shore
0x0469  /  0x1bf0 (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x046a  /  0x1bf5 (0x0009)  : on the shore at sand isle
0x046b  /  0x1bff (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x046c  /  0x1c04 (0x0004)  : on the sea
0x04b3  /  0x1c0a (0x003b)  :  with only a couple of clumps of coarse grass and stunted heathers struggling to survive in the hard stony ground. All was silent in that barren land, save for the faint sound of distant running water
0x04b4  /  0x1c46 (0x003d)  :  across a south-flowing river. Full steep and rocky were the valley sides on either hand. A tumble of elder, larch and willow found purchase on the western side, yet opposite was nought but stunted gorse
0x04b5  /  0x1c84 (0x0032)  :  in the middle of a dense forest. A profusion of bright flowers bejewelled the smooth green sward all around. A shaft of sunlight shone down TO the middle of the clearing
0x04b7  /  0x1cb8 (0x0051)  : , on a winding path that ran north and east below the canopy of leaves. The great beeches rose high on either side, their dense crowns touching and all but shutting out the sky. Sunlight dappled the branch tips and stray shafts broke through and danced in the woods beneath
0x04b8  /  0x1d0b (0x0011)  :  leading south through a dense growth of brier and bramble
0x04b9  /  0x1d1d (0x003b)  :  in the road, marked by a great stone cross. A rough and narrow track led southeast through a thorn thicket, while to the northeast lay a wide road, that ran smooth into the distance
0x04ba  /  0x1d59 (0x0021)  : . The squat bulk of Vagon Castle dominated the western skyline, its dark grey turrets standing out against the sky
0x04bc  /  0x1d7c (0x0023)  : , with a fine smooth surface of dressed stone flags, its grass verges close mown and speckled with small bright flowers
0x04bd  /  0x1da0 (0x0043)  :  with a tall, turreted tower and high arched windows of stained glass. From the neatly dressed stonework of the buttresses to the copper windvane atop the leaded roof, it spoke of great craftsmanship and dedication to the glory of its lord
0x04bf  /  0x1de6 (0x0032)  :  zigzagging narrowly up the steep and jagged face. The footing was treacherous, worn smooth by the passage of many people and by the rivulets of water that trickled down from above
0x04c0  /  0x1e19 (0x0048)  :  clad with springy turf and fragrant heathers. It rose like an island out of a sea of trees. A path wound across the KNOLL, all twisted like the engraving on a silver cup, and disappeared among the trees on either side [aka] knoll
0x04c1  /  0x1e63 (0x0037)  :  that lead north into a wood of tamarisk and juniper. For the length of a spear on either side, bushes were trampled and great branches broken, as if by the passage of some massive beast
0x04c2  /  0x1e9b (0x0029)  :  deep within the wood. To the north, the path opened into a clearing, its entrance marked by two shattered, burnt tree stumps
0x04c3  /  0x1ec5 (0x0030)  :  surrounded by blackened, broken trees. The bare ground has been scorched and stamped by the dragon in its unceasing fury, until it was as hard and unyielding as stone
0x04c4  /  0x1ef6 (0x0019)  :  heading south into a gloomy wood, the trees stunted and clad with grimy leaves
0x04c5  /  0x1f10 (0x0031)  :  within a dismal wood. A haze of smoke blocked out the sun, and the poor light that seeped through was absorbed by the soot and ash that lay thickly all around
0x04c6  /  0x1f42 (0x0023)  :  strewn with fallen trees, their boughs trampled and flattened. The air was heavy with acrid smoke and the stench of dragon
0x04c7  /  0x1f66 (0x0051)  :  of old stone flags that led in from the western gate. Silver green lichens grew along the sides of the pavement and in the narrow crevices between the stones. Mid-way along, on the right hand stood a holy HAWTHORN SHRUB, all decked with treasure [aka] hawthorn shrub
0x04c9  /  0x1fba (0x0029)  :  lined with standing stones. The eternal guardians of the way, their heavy presence weighing on the spirits of all who walked between their serried ranks
0x04cd  /  0x1fe5 (0x002a)  :  amongst the shrubs that grew at the base of the cliff. The path bended sometimes to left and right, but travelled generally eastwards and upwards
0x04ce  /  0x2010 (0x0019)  :  part way up the cliff. Here it narrowed as it wound its way around a rugged outcrop
0x04cf  /  0x202a (0x002c)  :  close to the top. The shrubs far below were mere splashes of green amongst the stark shadows of the jagged rocks at the base of the cliff
0x04d0  /  0x2057 (0x002c)  : , a crude stone hovel with a battered roof of turves. A sheepskin hung across the entrance and flapped loosely in the wind that gusted across the clifftop
0x04d1  /  0x2084 (0x0020)  : , a place of cold austerity. The crude lodgings of a man who had forsworn the comforts and pleasures of this world
0x04d2  /  0x20a5 (0x004d)  : . The stony waste stretched out both east and west as far as the eye could see. To the north it was bounded by a high cliff, its rugged face crossed by a thin straggling path. Southwards, a patch of dusty greenery told of water and human habitation
0x04d3  /  0x20f4 (0x001f)  :  that tracked through the wasteland. His horse picked a careful passage between the hard flints and troublesome pebbles
0x04d4  /  0x2114 (0x0006)  :  of smooth sward
0x04d5  /  0x211b (0x002c)  :  encompassed by a low wall of dressed stone. A clump of hardy trees grew close by, giving welcome shade in that dry, dusty land
0x04d6  /  0x2148 (0x002b)  : , standing square in the centre of the nave, between the slender fluted pillars of solid silver that rose high to the soaring vault of the ceiling
0x04d7  /  0x2174 (0x0025)  : , so tall and rugged that its top was scarcely to be seen. Coarse leaved trees grew low amongst the tumbled rocks
0x04d8  /  0x219a (0x001e)  :  encompassed entirely by close-set oaks. There was no way out save for the southern path whence Lancelot had come
0x04d9  /  0x21b9 (0x0012)  :  surrounded by oaks and flowering shrubs on all but the northern side
0x04da  /  0x21cc (0x0007)  :  that crumbled and shifted
0x04e2  /  0x21d5 (0x0032)  :  where he had spent the night, bedded on rough straw as befits one who would follow Our Lord. The drip of water echoed off the bare stone floor and walls
0x04e3  /  0x2208 (0x0023)  :  that was clad in soft shade, lit only by the warm glow of sunlight filtered through the gay fabrics of the tent
0x04e4  /  0x222c (0x0021)  : . The cool air was still and quiet, and motes of dust danced in the sunbeams that streamed through the narrow windows
0x04e5  /  0x224e (0x0026)  :  of gaunt grey stone. A flight of steps, guarded by two great lions, lead up to a door at the eastern end
0x04e6  /  0x2275 (0x0032)  :  wide enough for six knights to ride abreast, and high enough to fly a falcon. The walls were hung with richly embroidered tapestries and the flags of kings and princes
0x04e7  /  0x22a8 (0x0029)  : , a room of light and life. Heavenly sunlight streamed through the tall windows of stained glass and filled the chamber with the colours of glory
0x04e8  /  0x22d2 (0x003e)  : , a small room, lined with panelling of pale oak and furnished with pews of the same warm wood. A single candle was set in a holder on one wall and sent a flickering pale light into the room
0x0521  /  0x2312 (0x000d)  :  at the southern limits of a stony strand
0x0522  /  0x2320 (0x0011)  : , amid the tossing waves and the distant cries of gulls
0x0523  /  0x2332 (0x001c)  :  on a narrow, rocky beach at the foot of a cliff. A well-worn footpath lead upwards
0x0524  /  0x234f (0x000c)  :  near the eastern end of an isle
0x0525  /  0x235c (0x0027)  :  at the edge of a violent storm that rent the sky to south and east. So turbulent were the waves there that all passage was impossible
0x0526  /  0x2384 (0x0008)  :  of seaweed strewn pebbles
0x0527  /  0x238d (0x000f)  : , battered by a wind that blew from the eastern ocean
0x0528  /  0x239d (0x000f)  : , threading a wary passage through treacherous rocky reefs
0x0529  /  0x23ad (0x0016)  : , beneath the blue grey dome of the heavens that spanned the far horizons
0x052a  /  0x23c4 (0x0018)  :  where dark clouds filled the skies and distant lighting told of turbulent storms
0x052b  /  0x23dd (0x002c)  : , whipped by the cold salt wind and battered by the surging waves. Lancelot's TOUR had brought him to this place, but he found little here to treasure
0x052c  /  0x240a (0x0018)  : , riding waves that rose as high as hills and dipped again into deep valleys
0x052d  /  0x2423 (0x0024)  : , in the midst of the oceans. Even from the masthead there was nought to see but water and sky in all four quarters of the compass
0x052e  /  0x2448 (0x0023)  : , in a place of flat calm. Scarcely a breath of wind stirred the water or moved the heavy clouds that hung above
0x052f  /  0x246c (0x0033)  :  where endless clouds blocked out the light of the sun. A great wall loomed up at the edge of the shore, and in the midst of the wall was patch of paler grey
0x0530  /  0x24a0 (0x0014)  :  where the strand ended at great cliffs that reached down to the sea
0x0531  /  0x24b5 (0x0027)  : , caught up in swift currents and shallow waters. At times the sea was green with weed that grew on great reefs of sand below
0x0532  /  0x24dd (0x0016)  : . It was a small flat isle, encompassed by the ocean on three sides
0x0533  /  0x24f4 (0x001b)  : , in rain that so filled the air that none could see where the sea ended and the sky began
0x0534  /  0x2510 (0x001f)  : , at the edge of a gathering storm. Rain beat down from a darkening sky, drenching men to their souls
0x057b  /  0x2531 (0x001e)  : high above, a heron winged steadily eastward, beating a lonely track through a vast empty sky. 
0x057c  /  0x2550 (0x0036)  : 
 
of a sudden, the black knight rode out to greet Lancelot crying, "No worldly knight shall pass me". And straightway he smote Lancelot a mighty blow that spilled him to the ground. 
0x057d  /  0x2587 (0x003f)  : the damosel stepped forward and, raising her slender arms in welcome, invited him inside. The weary knight was entranced by her soft tones and her great beauty, and he looked upon her in wonder as she beckoned towards the pavilion. 
0x057f  /  0x25c9 (0x0047)  : 
 
the knight urged his steed down the track towards Lancelot, tilted his lance in greeting and said, "Hold fast traveller, I will give passage to any knight but he that is called Sir Lancelot. By your leave, please tell me your name". 
0x0580  /  0x2612 (0x004b)  : long, sharp thorns clawed at Lancelot's cloak, slowing his passage, and Lancelot pressed his horse hard to one side to allow a woodman to pass with a heavy bundle of sticks. The peasant sweated under their weight and under the sun that beat on his back. 
0x0581  /  0x265f (0x0025)  : Lancelot mopped his brown, FOR the weather was hot. Then he seemed to hear the clear ringing of church bells to the left. 
0x0582  /  0x2685 (0x0038)  : Occasional peasants and men-at-arms trudged past along the track. They were returning to ARTHUR'S city from the distant forest, their passage raising much dust, for it had not rained for many a day. 
0x0584  /  0x26bf (0x0024)  : Sparrows and finches sang gaily in the well-kempt beech hedges on either hand, before flying low into the nearby woodland. 
0x0585  /  0x26e4 (0x0062)  : 
 
the preacher stepped forth, from where he had been standing just outside the chapel porch and said, "Sir Lancelot, prince amongst knights, I greet you. I know of your quest and can help. If you will but pay me with the jewelled crown as a token of service to my Lord, I will help shorten your quest for the Holy Grail". 
0x0587  /  0x2749 (0x0058)  : 
 
a poor fisherman appeared and said, "Good knight, give us succour! Two great dragons are laying waste to this isle and striking terror into my people. They live yonder in clearings at the ends of that path". He pointed swiftly eastwards, then ran off with a terrible wailing. 
0x0588  /  0x27a3 (0x0021)  : an angry roar rumbled from the woods to the south and was echoed by another mighty roar in the far north. 
0x0589  /  0x27c5 (0x0023)  : a ragged strip of blood-stained sackcloth hung from a jagged branch tip, left by some poor peasant in his flight. 
0x058b  /  0x27ea (0x003b)  : a poor, solitary sapling was caught by a sudden breath of wind and nodded towards the great beast. On the instant, it lashed out a massive red claw and tore the young tree bodily from the ground. 
0x058c  /  0x2826 (0x001f)  : the wood was silent save for the quiet rustlings of small timid creatures that crept warily through the undergrowth. 
0x058d  /  0x2846 (0x001e)  : a coughing roar came from the southern end of the path, followed close by a billow of black smoke. 
0x058e  /  0x2865 (0x001e)  : Lancelot peered through the gloom, but could see no paths out, other than the one by which he had come. 
0x058f  /  0x2884 (0x0022)  : At the other end, Lancelot could see a squat grey antechapel, its ancient walls part clad in glossy ivy. 
0x0591  /  0x28a8 (0x0021)  : a deep rumbling came from the east, and it rolled among the silent stones and echoed from the valley walls. 
0x0595  /  0x28cb (0x0033)  : 
 
A follower of Nacien the Hermit ran down the path towards Lancelot, shouting, "Turn back from this path, I beg you". Then he vanished as swiftly as he came. 
0x0596  /  0x28ff (0x0036)  : 
 
A second disciple appeared and pleaded, "Oh, worthy knight. Why dost thou condemn us, that do you no harm?" Then he withdrew behind the ridge. 
0x0597  /  0x2936 (0x0044)  : 
 
A third follower of Nacien came forth and said unto Lancelot, "Turn back from this path, I beg you. Else my lord says that all his disciples must cast themselves from the cliffs above". Then he ran away upwards. 
0x0598  /  0x297c (0x004a)  : 
 
A fourth robed figure arrived to plead with Lancelot. "I am Nacien", he claimed, "Please come no further, for it is written that we are doomed should you attain the hermitage". He raise his hands in supplication, then disappeared. 
0x0599  /  0x29c8 (0x0090)  : 
 
Nacien laid aside his Bible and rose from his low stool as Lancelot entered. He heard the knight tell his tale of visitations upon the cliff path, and shook his head in wonder.
 
Right well had Lancelot done to press on, for it was not the hermit's followers, but fiends in their images, which had sought to turn Lancelot aside from the true path. Nacien praised Lancelot for his faithfulness, in pressing on against an enemy he could not fight with weapons, and offered unto him a CHALICE. 
0x059b  /  0x2a5c (0x001f)  : through the wavering air that rose from that hot earth, Lancelot could see a distant wall of green in the east. 
0x059c  /  0x2a7c (0x00bd)  : Gentle breezes stirred the trees WHILE Lancelot rode along.
 
Then, of a sudden, the woodland peace was shattered by the appearance of a cruel dwarf with lustful rage burning in his eyes. He dashed off through the HAZES to the south, his knife at the throat of a trembling maid.
 
As he passed, a group of knights appeared, riding north, and between them they bore Sir Ector, bound naked to his mount. And they flogged his body with sharp thorns that tore his flesh. For certain, there would be little time to rescue both, but should he turn first in aid of the innocent maiden or of his own brother? 
0x059d  /  0x2b3d (0x001a)  : the sunshine glinted harshly off a great white building on a slight HILL to the south. 
0x059f  /  0x2b59 (0x0024)  : two salamanders FOUGHT lazily in the hot sunshine. Then, seeing the knight, they turned and scuttled swiftly up a rough path. 
0x05a0  /  0x2b7e (0x005d)  : 
 
in the midst of the glade, Lancelot found Sir Ector beset by a merciless band of knights. Yet cowardly were they, as well as evil, and at the sight of Lancelot they fled forthwith without a fight. The worthy knight freed Sir Ector, who thanked him most gratefully before setting off once more upon his own quest. 
0x05a1  /  0x2bdd (0x0036)  : as Lancelot rode out into the sunlight, the vile dwarf released his helpless victim and took to his heels in terror. The maiden gave her heartfelt thanks to her saviour and bade him farewell. 
0x05a2  /  0x2c14 (0x0017)  : fine sand ran back and filled the footprints, wiping out all traces of passage. 
0x05aa  /  0x2c2d (0x000f)  : only the altar had been dressed with colour and richness. 
0x05ab  /  0x2c3d (0x001d)  : the damosel held out a plate of three dainty cakes to Lancelot, saying "Please eat your fill". 
0x05ac  /  0x2c5b (0x0022)  : Lancelot realised that this was a true church, for all that a fiend had waited without to tempt him, and he knelt and prayed. 
0x05ad  /  0x2c7e (0x0019)  : at the sight of Lancelot, the lions leaped up as if to block the way to the east. 
0x05ae  /  0x2c98 (0x002d)  : though no sound reached the ear, it seemed there was the music of angels close at hand. Glorious light beckoned him from a chamber at the eastern end. 
0x05af  /  0x2cc6 (0x003b)  : 
 
And angels did sing while the holy Joseph of Arimathea did say mass for the knights. Lancelot dropped on bended knee and gave grateful thanks to the Lord for that he had fulfilled his quest. 
0x05b0  /  0x2d02 (0x001a)  : Bors and Percival were there and bowed low to Lancelot, and welcomed him that he had joined them. 
0x0640  /  0x2d1f (0x0003)  : Lancelot could see

The company of knights went each his own way, all searching for the Holy Grail. But Lancelot lagged behind, worried lest he fail in his duty, and had barely reached Vagon Castle, at the eastern side of Camelot, when darkness came..
0x09c5  /  0x327c (0x003a)  : , the dutiful knight, bended his knee and made humble prayer at the holy altar, that God would bless his quest. For it was not by sword, but by the will of the Almighty that the Holy GRAIL might be attained
0x09c6  /  0x32b7 (0x002b)  : Lancelot was troubled by the sense of an important deed left undone, though he could put no name to his omission. Did he turn back from his path? 
0x09c7  /  0x32e3 (0x002b)  : 
Lancelot was heavy with guilt that he had forgotten to pray to God, for his path should be the path of the Lord, and his strength the strength of Faith
0x09c8  /  0x330f (0x0025)  : but he was troubled in his spirit, as though thunder clouds hung low overhead, lest he had broken some TABOO in taking it
0x09c9  /  0x3335 (0x002b)  : the preacher took the marvellous crown, then threw back his head and laughed loudly with malice and irony. At that instant he vanished and the crown vanished with him

0x09cb  /  0x3369 (0x001a)  : was revealed as a fiend, spun around and and disappeared, cackling foul insults, into the air
0x09cc  /  0x3384 (0x0026)  : vanished in a whirling cloud of evil. Lancelot was adread and called aloud to Jesu Christ for help that he might complete the quest
0x09cd  /  0x33ab (0x001f)  : the pavilion turned up-so-down, and then it changed unto a smoke, and a black cloud, and in an instant 
0x09ce  /  0x33cb (0x0006)  : said a devout prayer
0x09cf  /  0x33d2 (0x0002)  : rode

0x09d9  /  0x3401 (0x0007)  : as Lancelot turned away from her
0x09da  /  0x3409 (0x0060)  : ate the last cake. 
The damosel breathed heavily and murmured, "Ah, Sir Lancelot, bravest of all knights, long have I yearned to have your strong arms around me, to mingle our souls in pleasure. Come, I am weak with longing. Lie with me now". She gestured languidly to the enticing bed that stood close by
0x09db  /  0x346b (0x0028)  : was suffused with well-being as if all his powers had been restored unto him. It beseemed him that once more he had become the best knight in all the world
0x09dc  /  0x3494 (0x0022)  : ate the cake and it was good. Sweet flavours filled his mouth and a sense of new strength grew within him
0x09dd  /  0x34b7 (0x005a)  : Lancelot succumbed to the charms of the damosel, most tenderly and earnestly. Then as he lost himself in passion, he saw the damosel change. 
Lancelot jumped back in horror as she was revealed as a foul and ugly fiend. It rose up above him, screaming and shrieking with vile laughter and vanished in a whirling blackness
0x09de  /  0x3513 (0x002f)  : the damosel sighed with regret. "Oh worthy knight," she said, "It seems that in the joust between pleasure and honour, honour must always win"
0x09df  /  0x3543 (0x0013)  : the fair damosel took Lancelot by the hand and led him into the pavilion
0x09e0  /  0x3557 (0x0022)  : the knight of the wood drew his sword in readiness and called, "Good sir, I demand that you give your name"
0x09e1  /  0x357a (0x0018)  : "Pass friend", cried the knight of the wood, raising his blade in salute
0x09e2  /  0x3593 (0x0020)  : "Then die, Sir Lancelot!" He cried, urging his mount into the charge and swinging his sword about him
0x09e3  /  0x35b4 (0x0014)  : to the ground, crying, "No worldly knight shall pass this place"
0x09e4  /  0x35c9 (0x000a)  : the black knight stood aside and waved on
0x09e6  /  0x35d5 (0x001d)  : the preacher stopped Lancelot, saying, "Nay my lord. First you must render the crown unto me"
0x09e7  /  0x35f3 (0x001e)  : the damosel fluttered her long eyelashes and said, "Oh sir! Please wait until we are within"
0x09e8  /  0x3612 (0x0020)  : the damosel held forth the plate and said, "I have made these goodly cakes for you. Please eat of them first"
0x09e9  /  0x3633 (0x0044)  : as Lancelot once more made the holy sign of the cross a voice of thunder spoke to him, "Lancelot, why do you persist to take my sign in vain?" Lancelot was stricken down on hearing such a rebuke, and realised his quest was wasted

0x0a0f  /  0x36de (0x0028)  : Lancelot knew he had committed the deadly sin of Pride, for thinking himself worthy to take this sword, that was only for the best knight in the world
0x0a14  /  0x3708 (0x0006)  : the tomb was closed
0x0a15  /  0x370f (0x001f)  : a foul fiend emerged with a hideous shriek, that clawed at his heart like talons of ice and fire
0x0a16  /  0x372f (0x002d)  : Galahad advanced and struck out at the fiend. As he did so, a host of angels sprung to his aid and, quailing before their power, the fiend fled
0x0a17  /  0x375d (0x0005)  : buried the body
0x0a18  /  0x3763 (0x000f)  : was struck down by a bolt of lightning for his pride
0x0a19  /  0x3773 (0x0006)  : Galahad knelt and prayed, then
0x0a1a  /  0x377a (0x004f)  : the green knight had Lancelot at his mercy. He raised his sword to MAYBE strike the final blow, but then held back and lowered his blade. "Sir Lancelot," he said, "I must avow that you have fought bravely, and I shall spare your life. You are free to pass"
0x0a1b  /  0x37cb (0x0023)  : the fiend drew back into the tomb, merging itself into the body of a false christian man and thence vanishing from sight
0x0a1c  /  0x37ef (0x0009)  : said a benediction over the body
0x0a1d  /  0x37f9 (0x0013)  : Lancelot was honour bound not to attack one who had shown him such generosity
0x0a1e  /  0x380d (0x000e)  : blew the horn, and a magical wind sprang up
0x0a1f  /  0x381c (0x000a)  : the wall of fire blocked the way
0x0a20  /  0x3827 (0x0008)  : helped to dampen the flames
0x0a21  /  0x3830 (0x0009)  : the fire welled up more fiercely
0x0a22  /  0x383a (0x0007)  : finally quenched the flames
0x0a23  /  0x3842 (0x0005)  : could not hold water
0x0a24  /  0x3848 (0x0004)  : was already full
0x0a28  /  0x384e (0x0040)  : Lancelot heard a voice call in urgent warning, "Galahad is in danger for his life". Lancelot took direction from the voice and hastened to the aid of his son, riding swiftly to the place where he was in danger..
0x0a2a  /  0x3891 (0x0013)  : Galahad was bound to a great stake set in the middle of the road
0x0a2b  /  0x38a5 (0x000c)  : the bonds were too tight to be untied
0x0a2c  /  0x38b2 (0x0042)  : 
 
as Lancelot fled for his life, he heard behind him the screams as Galahad died. He stumbled down from his horse and wept bitterly that he had proved unworthy of his quest and that his cowardice had condemned his son to such a fate
0x0a2d  /  0x38f6 (0x006f)  : of a sudden, the skies opened, and bolts of lightning struck down Galahad's foes to left and right, and those fled in terror that were not slain. One last great bolt struck the stake and loosed Galahad from his bonds. The young knight dropped to his knees and humbly gave thanks to the lord for his deliverance. Then rising, he turned to Lancelot and offered to help him to attain the Grail
0x0a2e  /  0x3967 (0x0025)  : Lancelot realized that no matter how hard he strove on his quest, he could never could attain the Holy Grail without the aid of Galahad

0x0a31  /  0x39ac (0x0017)  : the pilgrim tried to scoop water from the well, but it trickled through his boney fingers
0x0a32  /  0x39c4 (0x0027)  : the water surface dropped down the well, drawing away from Lancelot. He wondered at this, then it came to him that his sins were repellent to the holy water
0x0a33  /  0x39ec (0x0040)  : with the help of Lancelot, the pilgrim reached into the well and filled the chalice. He drank deeply, and was forthwith revived by the healing holy water. He handed the chalice back to Lancelot, rose up and once more set out upon his pilgrimage
0x0a34  /  0x3a2e (0x003f)  : Lancelot saw that the fair maiden had been abused most violently by her abductor, then slain without mercy. He knew that this had happened because of his failure to go to her aid, and that he would never now attain the Grail
0x0a35  /  0x3a6f (0x003e)  : Lancelot saw only a large pool of blood that told a sorrowful tale. He had come too late, and his brother Ector had been slain because of his sloth. Lancelot realised that he was not worthy to attain the Grail
0x0a36  /  0x3aae (0x0029)  : the screams of a young woman rang out in the distance. Striking horror into Lancelot's heart. He knew that he must hasten to her with all speed

0x0a50  /  0x3aff (0x000c)  : was not holy enough to pass through the gate
0x0a51  /  0x3b0c (0x007d)  : 
 
the red and the black dragons set about each other forthwith and fought a roaring, savage battle. At last the great red beast dropped to the ground, wounded unto death. Yet even as it died, it gave a mighty lash with its flailsome tail that did break the neck of its slayer. When all was still, the people of the isle came up and brought unto Lancelot a cup of mead in token of their gratitude
0x0a52  /  0x3b8b (0x0027)  : said, "We will gladly help you here, but we cannot yet leave the antechapel - for it is not yet time for us to see the Grail"
0x0a53  /  0x3bb3 (0x0025)  : said, "Father, I cannot pass through this door, for that way leads to the Grail. I must remain here and pray for forgiveness"
0x0a57  /  0x3bda (0x0013)  : the wind made the fire spirit to flicker, but did not still its fury
0x0a58  /  0x3bee (0x0010)  : the wind did but make ripples on the surface of the water spirit
0x0a59  /  0x3bff (0x000c)  : the wind blew away the sand spirit and scattered it
0x0a5a  /  0x3c0c (0x0006)  : a fire spirit appeared
0x0a5b  /  0x3c13 (0x0005)  : a water spirit appeared
0x0a5c  /  0x3c19 (0x0005)  : a sand spirit appeared
0x0a5d  /  0x3c1f (0x0008)  : quenched the fire spirit entirely
0x0a5e  /  0x3c28 (0x0009)  : gave much pleasure to the spirit
0x0a5f  /  0x3c32 (0x000f)  : ran through the sand spirit and drained away without harming it
0x0a60  /  0x3c42 (0x0012)  : crackled and sparkled as it touched the fire spirit, then dropped away
0x0a61  /  0x3c55 (0x0006)  : soaked up the water spirit
0x0a62  /  0x3c5c (0x000a)  : gave new vigor to the sand spirit
0x0a63  /  0x3c67 (0x000a)  : the spirit replaced the key and disappeared
0x0a64  /  0x3c72 (0x0016)  : singing voices told Lancelot to have faith in God and to walk onwards to the Grail
0x0a65  /  0x3c89 (0x0012)  : Lancelot was not free of sin, for which he could not pass through
0x0a66  /  0x3c9c (0x001f)  : Lancelot knew that Nacien could nevermore forgiven him his sins, and thence would the Sangrail be ever hidden from his sight
0x0a67  /  0x3cbc (0x008d)  : 
 
At length, Lancelot withdrew from the chamber of the Holy Grail, and eventually returned to Camelot. The worthy knights, Galahad, Bors and Percival were also blessed and did attain the Grail in the fullness of time. 
 
Lancelot returned to Camelot, where he told Arthur of his deeds, and then, at length, he retired to serve God as a hermit. 
 
As for the history of Arthur and of Guenever, that is for another time. Meanwhile, congratulations on winning this game!.

0x0a84  /  0x3dcf (0x000e)  : The elemental spirits had the better of you that time
0x0a85  /  0x3dde (0x000e)  : May the Lord forgive you for this terrible sin
0x0a86  /  0x3ded (0x003e)  : Father, we are taught that to cross oneself in times of need is good. But gluttony of any sort is a sin. And when you take His symbol in vain, that also does break His commandments

0x0a89  /  0x3e51 (0x0044)  : I would speak with you". Then he moved close to Lancelot and said, "What of honour? What of your vows of truth? You have betrayed all that is good and knightly. And for this sin must you beg forgiveness from the holy man, Nacien
0x0a8a  /  0x3e97 (0x000b)  : Father, you must not entertain such thoughts
0x0a8b  /  0x3ea3 (0x0014)  : Father, I will pray to God for a favourable wind. God will provide

0x0a8f  /  0x3ee2 (0x002a)  : Father, not even I am pure enough to reach into this well. Only one who has endured the many hardships of a long pilgrimage could drink from here
0x0a90  /  0x3f0d (0x001b)  : Father, I cannot explain your dream. Only Nacien, the wise and good hermit can help you
0x0abe  /  0x3f2a (0x0011)  : Nacien looked at Lancelot and spoke: "My son, you have sinned

0x0b9a  /  0x477d (0x0051)  : said, "Father, methinks this preacher is false. His manner speaks of equivocation".
The preacher looked sadly at Galahad, "You are greatly mistaken, my son. Your knightly prowess is great, but methinks you still have much to learn about courtesy. I shall pray for your enlightenment"
0x0b9b  /  0x47d0 (0x0014)  : said, "Father, a great evil was once perpetrated at this place"
0x0b9c  /  0x47e5 (0x002c)  : said, "Sir Knight, I am Galahad, son of Lancelot". The knight raised his sword in salute and replied, "My quarrel is with your father, not with you"

0x0c1f  /  0x4967 (0x000f)  : now that is a most peculiar thing to want to do

0x0c23  /  0x498e (0x0011)  : have you lost your wits? Fancy trying such a thing
0x0c24  /  0x49a0 (0x000d)  : that is a most strange thing to want to do
0x0c25  /  0x49ae (0x000a)  : such actions denote an addled brain
0x0c26  /  0x49b9 (0x0009)  : a goodly try, my friend
0x0c27  /  0x49c3 (0x0018)  : a truly valiant attempt at a solution. 'Tis a shame it will not work
0x0c28  /  0x49dc (0x000f)  : oh ho! There is no chance of that succeeding
0x0c29  /  0x49ec (0x0017)  : that really does deserve some credit, though in truth it does not work
0x0c2a  /  0x4a04 (0x0014)  : with ideas like that, you will go far. In the fullness of time
0x0c2b  /  0x4a19 (0x000e)  : a good shot, but one that misses its mark
0x0c2c  /  0x4a28 (0x000f)  : a fair tilt, but it has done no good
0x0c2d  /  0x4a38 (0x0009)  : almost, but not quite right
0x0c2e  /  0x4a42 (0x0014)  : such inventiveness should have some reward. Alas, it will receive none
0x0c2f  /  0x4a57 (0x000d)  : the approach was good, but the finish poor
0x0c30  /  0x4a65 (0x000a)  : you might as well leave well alone
0x0c31  /  0x4a70 (0x000a)  : I suggest that you forget such matters
0x0c32  /  0x4a7b (0x000a)  : prithee concentrate on things of import

0x0c38  /  0x4ab9 (0x0008)  : Lancelot found nothing of interest
0x0c39  /  0x4ac2 (0x000e)  : tis mere decoration. Put it from your mind
0x0c3a  /  0x4ad1 (0x000f)  : now what was the object of that? Try again
0x0c3b  /  0x4ae1 (0x000c)  : alas, I could find no object in that
0x0c3c  /  0x4aee (0x0005)  : please be more precise

0x0c42  /  0x4b39 (0x000e)  : your command seemed incomplete. Please tell me once more
0x0c43  /  0x4b48 (0x000b)  : please tell me what object to do that to
0x0c44  /  0x4b54 (0x0007)  : alas, that was fruitless
0x0c45  /  0x4b5c (0x0008)  : that did not seem to work
0x0c46  /  0x4b65 (0x0008)  : that had no effect on anything
0x0c47  /  0x4b6e (0x0006)  : that was marvellously useless
